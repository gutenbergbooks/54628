<h2 class="no-break"><a id="Ref_23"></a>Gain, Loss, and Problem in Recent History Teaching</h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM MACDONALD, OF BROWN UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p>The newer methods of history teaching
which were authoritatively set forth for the
first time in this country in the report of
the Committee of Seven of the American
Historical Association, and which during
the past ten years have increasingly made
their way in the better secondary schools,
have had for their aim the emancipation of
history from the bondage of mere mechanical
routine, the clearer discrimination of
essentials and non-essentials, the use of
comparison and judgment as well as of
memory in the mastery of historical knowledge,
the systematic exploration of books
other than the textbook, and the intelligent
correlation of the subject with literature,
art, economics, geography, and other
kindred fields.</p>

<p>That there should have been criticism,
not seldom unfriendly, of the new methods
and their results is only natural. The new
procedure had to be learned by teachers as
well as by pupils, and its application to the
conditions of particular schools determined
by careful study of local possibilities and
needs. What was possible in a large and
generously supported school was not
equally attainable in a small and poor one;
and it was inevitable that mistakes should
be made even by those most interested in
making the new work a success. No more
in history than in language or mathematics,
both of which have undergone pedagogical
reformation in our day, was perfection to
be won at the outset.</p>

<p>All things considered, however, it seems
to me indisputable that, wherever there has
been an honest and earnest attempt to
make the new methods successful, a gratifying
and very considerable measure of
success has been attained. Broadly speaking,
the formal recitation, based mainly
upon the study of a textbook, has been
given up. The history of England is no
longer generally studied by the reigns of
sovereigns, nor the history of the United
States by presidential administrations.
There is wide use of source books and
documents, and much intelligent reading
in narrative histories, biographies, journals,
letters, travels, and other literature. Map-drawing
is extensively required, and illustrated
lectures or talks and historical excursions
have been made to contribute their
wealth of information and interest. From
every point of view, the position of history
in the school curriculum is more dignified
and rational than it used to be, its pedagogical
method more intelligent, its fruition
in knowledge and power more valuable.</p>

<p>No method of teaching, however, is ever
so bad that its abandonment is not attended
with some loss to the pupil. In spite of
all the success which has undeniably come
about in these ten years of thoughtful and
friendly effort, there still remain a number
of steps imperatively to be taken
before the teaching of history in secondary
schools can, without serious qualification,
be pronounced satisfactory. There is still a
woeful need of trained history teachers.
While the larger city high schools and
many private schools are praiseworthy exceptions,
it nevertheless remains true that
the majority of schools do not yet think
it necessary to choose for the historical
department a teacher specially trained for
that work. The subject is still too often
assigned to this teacher or that who happens
to have the necessary free time, but
whose serious equipment lies in some other
field. Nothing short of sound and extended
college training in history should be deemed
a sufficient preparation for the teaching of
history in a secondary school, just as nothing
short of such training, and the frank
recognition of its importance by school
authorities, will overcome the unfortunate
reluctance of the best college graduates to
enter secondary school work. No graduate
of Brown University can receive from the
department of history a certificate of fitness
to teach history in a high school or
academy who has not completed with credit
at least four courses, each of three hours
a week for a year, and one of them a
course of research; and I should be glad did
conditions in the schools make it possible
to raise, as they do make it increasingly
easy to enforce this minimum requirement.</p>

<p>A second crying need is for better equipment
of the historical department. The
development of school libraries has not yet
made much progress, and the use of public
libraries by large classes has obvious practical
limitations. Schools which willingly
spend money for scientific apparatus decline
to spend money for books, pictures, and
other illustrative material. The equipment
of wall-maps is often exceedingly poor,
historical maps being often lacking altogether
except in the field of ancient history.
Until this lack is supplied, we must expect
that the teacher will from necessity rely
mainly upon the textbook, at the cost of
failing to meet the most fundamental condition
of the newer methods of history
teaching.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most serious charge that is
lodged against the new method is that it
fails to give the pupil exact knowledge,
and even discriminates against exactness
and precision. My observation as an examiner
of applicants for admission to college
leads me to believe that there is force in
this charge. Undoubtedly the amount of
ground which is expected to be covered by
those who take any one of the four fields
recommended by the Committee of Seven
is very great, in the field of medieval and
modern European history quite too great.
Where the time allotted to the course in the
curriculum is insufficient, as it often is, or
where the teacher is incompetent, or where
the facilities of the department are inadequate,
it is inevitable that the work should
be slighted and the results upon examination
appear unsatisfactory. Undoubtedly,
also, in our zeal for the broad view and
the vivifying treatment, we have tended
unconsciously to depreciate the value of
exact knowledge, and have allowed ourselves
to think that because the function
of memorizing may easily be overworked,
the memory has no place in the study of
history at all.</p>

<p>The examiners in history for the College
Entrance Examination Board have learned
that, unless they ask for dates, no dates
will be given; that the treatment of specific
questions of limited scope is prevailingly
slovenly, indicative of loose thinking
and tolerated looseness of expression; and
that the simplest questions will often be
carelessly misread. I am sure that we have
not yet solved the problem of examining in
history either in school or in college, but I
am also compelled to think that the greatest
weakness of history teaching at present,
in those schools in which the new program
is being applied, is that it so often
fails to give the pupil a definite knowledge
of anything. I do not despair, however.
There are signs of improvement, growing
in number and significance every year; and
with the increased employment of skilled
teachers, the provision of better facilities
for teaching, and the more generous recognition
of the importance of the subject, we
may, I think, confidently look for results
commensurate with those admittedly attained
in other branches of the school curriculum.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_24"></a>Training the History Teacher<br />
<span class="largefont">The Organization of His Field of Study</span></h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY NORMAN MACLAREN TRENHOLME, PROFESSOR OF THE TEACHING OF HISTORY, SCHOOL OF EDUCATION,
UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI.</p>

<p>Provided that the text-books have been
selected and the courses to be given
arranged for by some higher power, the
first problem that faces the history teacher
in the fall is that of properly organizing
the field or fields of study. Now we all
know that many teachers do not realize
this problem or that if they do they shirk
it and adopt a sort of go-as-you-please plan
of so many pages each day, irrespective of
topical or any other sort of unity, that
usually results in careless recitation work
and an incomplete course. In some cases
the teacher seeks aid and guidance from a
printed syllabus or outline of the course to
be covered, and if these are available and
properly constructed in connection with the
text-books used, they can be of great service,
but they cannot wholly relieve the
teacher of responsibility as to the length
and character of topics to be considered.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Even the best teachers are inclined to adopt
a day-to-day plan of organization and so
work blindly, not knowing how much of the
text-book will, in the end be left unstudied.
Such unsatisfactory conditions as are here
referred to are totally unnecessary if history
teachers will only learn to organize
their courses in advance of giving them and
thus be able to round out their work in a
thoroughly satisfactory manner. The reason
that this is not done is that most of
our high school teachers of history have
had little or no training in the teaching of
their subject and have not learned how to
handle and interpret the subject matter to
the best advantage. What some lack in
training they make up for in enthusiasm
and interest in their work, but there are,
unfortunately for the profession, many
teachers of history who have neither training
nor enthusiasm. On the other hand,
the number of trained, earnest and enthusiastic
teachers of history is constantly increasing,
and there are opportunities offered
for every teacher to improve his or her
methods and enter more understandingly
and more successfully into the work of
teaching the subject. The greatest danger
in history work in schools is the prevalence
of matter over spirit, of facts over thoughts
and ideas, of mechanical memory work over
constructive thinking and reasoning. If
teachers of history will learn to enter into
their work with more spirit and understanding
the subject will soon be regarded
with respect on account of the vital interest
that the development of the present out of
the past must always have. One way of
emphasizing historical unity or continuity
is by a well-planned series of recitation or
discussion topics based on the text-book
used in the course, and it is the question
of such organization of the field of study
that I wish to discuss in this article.</p>


<h3>General Suggestions as to the Organization.</h3>

<p>The history teacher who wishes to make
a success of the courses given must plan
the work in advance according to certain
common sense rules and conditions. In the
first place, the extent of the subject matter
to be covered must be carefully considered
in connection with the time allotted for its
completion, and the relative emphasis to
be placed on the different portions of the
period to be covered. Instead of a haphazard
assignment of so many pages each day
irrespective of time and subject matter, the
length and character of the lesson assignments
should be plotted out in advance. If
the number of pages of text-book subject
matter be accurately ascertained (many
text-books have pages of outlines, review
questions, references, and so forth), and
compared with the number of recitation
hours available, from which it is well to
deduct one-third or one-fourth for reviews,
a mechanical basis of assignments can be
had. But a mechanical basis is not alone
sufficient, a topical one is necessary also.
This is the most difficult and at the same
time the most vital part of organization
and the part in which most teachers fail
on account of poor perspective as to important
and unimportant topics and a failure
to realize the inner meaning and significance
of the external events with which
they are dealing. Fortunately most history
text-books have been constructed on
a skeleton of topics, and even a poorly-trained
teacher can, with a little care, discover
the proper lesson divisions. Some of
the newer text-books go so far, indeed, as
to give a series of lesson topics which the
teacher can follow.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A competent history teacher, however,
should not need to depend entirely on the
text-book, outline, or syllabus, but should
be able to select his or her own topics with
judgment and success. A teacher properly
trained to interpret the subject matter of
the different fields of study who will take
into account the length of time available
and the extent of the text to be covered,
can successfully plan out any desired course
of study from beginning to end. This plan
does not need to be absolutely rigid, but
it will be a valuable guide for the work of
the year or half year and will lead to a
successful completion of the course of
study. Instructors in normal schools and
in college departments of education can
easily train the students in courses on the
teaching of history to make such topical
outlines based on standard text-books. It
will be time well spent, as the student will
afterwards find in active teaching, as one
such experience in enlightened planning out
of a field of study will lead to competent
handling of other fields.</p>


<h3>Organization of the Ancient History Field.</h3>

<p>If we say that this field of study should
deal with the political, governmental, social,
and cultural development of the western
portion of the Ancient World under the
three main divisions of (a) the Oriental
nations, excluding, of course, India, China
and Japan; (b) the Greek world, and (c)
the Roman world&mdash;then we have a fairly
comprehensive definition of what is to be covered.
If we add to this that the chief teaching
problem of the course is so to organize
and interpret the subject matter as to bring
out in a clear and connected way the really
significant and essential movements and
developments during ancient times in connection
with the leading historical peoples,
we are giving greater definiteness to the
teaching work of the course. But what are
the really significant and essential movements
in the history of the ancient world
from the pedagogical viewpoint? Can it
not be said that they are those that have
most continuity with and exerted most influence
on later Mediterranean and European
history? To this end emphasis should
be especially laid on the Greek world,
centering in Athens, and on Rome,
centering in her great imperial system.
As a general rule, teachers of ancient history
are inclined to give too great a proportion
of the time at their disposal to the
Oriental empires and their civilizations, to
early Greek history and archæology, to
Roman legendary history, and the petty
politics and mythical conflicts of the early
Roman republic, and the governmental
organization of the decaying republic, while
Athenian life and thought, Macedonian imperialism
and its results, the rise and
organization of the great Roman empire,
the causes of its strength, and of its weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and decline are not given sufficient
time and attention.</p>

<p>In the general organization of the Ancient
History field the topics should be so
planned that the teacher and class will
work from a broad study of the Oriental
peoples of the eastern Mediterranean world
and of the early history of the Greek peoples
and States to a more careful and intensive
examination into the Athenian
world as typical of the best of classic
Greece, of Alexander and Macedonian imperialism,
as promoters of Hellenic culture.
The early Roman period should be rapidly
covered and far less time spent on the
republic and its government. The object
in organizing the Roman portion of the
Ancient History field should be to emphasize
the growth of the Roman empire and
the creation of an imperial system. To this
end as much attention as possible should
be directed to the provinces and to the
general problems of the imperial government.
The influence of the Roman historians,
Livy, Suetonius, and even to some extent
of Tacitus (I refer to the annals and
histories), and of teachers of the classics
is responsible for much wrong perspective
in the teaching of Ancient History. Nor
have we one really well-proportioned textbook
for this field, though several of the
existing ones are fairly satisfactory. The
success and interest of the ancient history
course depends largely on the teacher’s
power of selection, organization, and interpretation.</p>


<h3>Organization of the Field of Medieval and Modern History.</h3>

<p>In organizing this field of study, while
following the general rules of organization,
the teacher should remember that the object
of this course is above all else to
make the student familiar with his present
historical environment and its immediate
background. To this end it is desirable
that a large proportion of the time should
be devoted to bringing out and emphasizing
movements and institutions that have distinctly
modern significance, and that recent
European history should be carefully
studied. This does not mean, however, that
the medieval portion of the field should be
neglected as an important contributory
factor in modern civilization. Emphasis
should be laid on the continuity of Roman
influence, as seen in the imperial Church
and the imperial State and in Roman law,
on the Christian religion as a factor in advancing
civilization, and on the contribution
of political, social and economic importance
made by the Germans. The medieval world
is more foreign to the schoolboy mind than
even that of Greece and Rome, and the
struggles of popes and emperors, the intricacies
of feudalism, and the ascetic and adventurous
aspects of the Crusades are hard
for him to understand. But the feelings of
nationality against imperial control by
Church or State, the growth of the towns
and commerce, the gradual development of
representative government, the struggles
against despotism&mdash;these are things he can
understand and appreciate and in connection
with which he can see the present
emerging from the past. Nor should the
great personalities of medieval and modern
history be neglected, for they have historical
interest and importance and serve to
give greater interest and definiteness to
movements of which they are a part. A
little thought and care on the part of the
teacher in planning the lesson assignments
and conducting the recitation will keep the
course from becoming dull and meaningless.
The attention of the class should
always be drawn to the bearing of what
they are studying on present conditions and
particular emphasis should be directed to
great international movements as well as
to the growth and development of the leading
European countries. In no field of high
school study does careful previous organization
lead to more satisfactory results
than in the medieval and modern field.</p>


<h3>Organization of the English History Field.</h3>

<p>The organization and treatment of this
field should be based on the idea of bringing
out clearly the origin, growth and larger
developments of English political, social
and economic institutions. The field offers
especial advantages for developmental
study, as the history is well connected
throughout, and can be easily organized
into topics and problems. All that the
teacher needs is a little insight into the
fundamental factors and influences in
English history, and this should be obtained
from any well conducted general
course in English history. The history of
England should always be organized and
treated as being the study of the growth
of a great imperial nation out of various
elements and through different policies.
The idea of the growth of free, representative
government (the power of the people,
or democracy, in government) is the predominant
note, but the broader viewpoint
of the growth of national civilization as
shown in policies, industry, art, language
and letters is also desirable and important.
Among the dangers to be avoided in
teaching English history, and in teaching
how to organize it, is the temptation to
emphasize the minor political details relating
to royalties, wars and so forth. The
history of England is after all closely related
to the history of Europe, and the
two great questions of interest in her story
are those of her internal development along
national lines and of her external policy
and growth along imperial lines. More
attention than is now given could well be
bestowed on the British empire, and it is
a pleasure to find one text-book at least
that attempts to do justice to this important
phase of English history and government.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h3>Organization of the Field of American History and Government.</h3>

<p>Probably all teachers of American history
will admit that broadly stated the
course in American history and government
should be organized with special
emphasis on the national period, and
should represent an attempt to show how
out of the diversity of the colonial period
there finally emerged the spirit of federal
union, and how American history largely
centers around the erection of a sovereign
federal state, in face of English opposition,
and the maintenance of the union, in the
face of internal dissensions, and finally,
the growth and expansion of the United
States as a world power. The European
background, the native or American background,
exploration, colonization and colonial
development must all be touched on
lightly. Then a careful study should be
made of the steps leading up to union
and to independence, though the military
side of the revolutionary struggle is frequently
over-emphasized, and the beginnings
of national government as we know
it to-day can be studied in connection with
the formation of the constitution. Territorial
expansion, foreign and civil wars,
colonial expansion and problems of internal
development can all be treated in relation
with the central problem of successful
federal government and in relation with
the present. Interwoven frequently with
American national history is the history of
one’s own state, and teachers can frequently
use local interests to make the story of
some particular phase of national development
more real and significant.</p>

<p>There is quite a marked tendency to separate
American government from American
history in the fourth year of the high
school, and to give a half year’s work in
each subject. If American government is
taught as a separate subject a text-book
should be selected which allows the teacher
to organize the course so as to work from
the familiar to the unfamiliar aspects of
government, from the local to the national
aspects of the field of study. Several good
text-books of this character have been
recently published.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The attempt has been made in this article
to show how the history teacher can be
trained, or can train himself, to organize
thoroughly the field of study to be covered
so as to complete the course in the time
allotted and also bring out the meaning and
importance of the study undertaken.
Proper organization of the field of study
will undoubtedly aid the teacher greatly,
but such organization must be followed by
successful recitation and class-room work.
The next paper in this department will
therefore, be devoted to a discussion of the
training of history teachers in the organization
of the recitation.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_26"></a>Instruction in American Government in Secondary Schools</h2>

<p class="center boldfont mediumfont">A COMMENT ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIVE.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By William A. Schapes</span>,<br />
Chairman of the Committee of Five, Professor
of Political Science, University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis.</p>

<p>The American Political Science Association
has taken an interest, not only in the
investigation and discussion of the scientific
questions arising within the field of
Political Science, but has also paid attention
to the problem of improving the instruction
in Government in our schools and colleges.
To further this work a section on instruction
in Political Science was organized at its
first annual meeting. In 1906 the committee
of five, originally of three members, was
appointed to complete certain investigations
which had been started in the section on
instruction, the partial results of which
had been published in a paper by the writer
in the proceedings for 1905. The committee
was required to ascertain the amount and
kind of instruction in American Government
being offered in the secondary schools
of this country and make recommendations
for the consideration of the association.
In accordance with these instructions the
committee undertook to collect its information
directly by correspondence with the
teachers in about 600 high schools distributed
throughout the United States. The
work extended over more than two years,
the final report being read at the Richmond
meeting in December, 1908, and published in
the proceedings for that year.</p>

<p>The point on which the report lays greatest
stress, namely, the necessity of teaching
Government as a distinct subject in the
secondary schools, was expressly approved
by the association without a dissenting vote.
It does not follow, of course, that the report
expresses the views of every member
of that association, in every particular. In
fact it does not. The report does represent
the views of the entire committee after
making an exhaustive study of the question.</p>

<p>The report covers 38 pages of the proceedings,
and is therefore too elaborate to
be properly presented in a brief article.
Only a few of the essential features will
be referred to.</p>

<p>At the very outset the committee was
confronted with the pedagogical question
as to whether Government should be taught
as a distinct subject or whether it should
be taught in connection with history.
The teachers are still somewhat divided on
the subject, and practice varies. The information
collected indicates that the teaching
of American Government, Civil Government
or Civics as it is still barbarously
designated, is suffering from a lack of proper
recognition in the school curriculum, for
want of especially trained teachers, from
lack of a working school library on Government
and from inadequate text-books. It
seems a curious thing that our public
schools, which were instituted and are operated
by governmental agency to maintain
an enlightened citizenship, have taught
every other subject excepting Government.
There can be little doubt that the rather
confused and contradictory recommendations
of the Committee of Seven ten years
ago helped materially to spread the impression
among high school teachers that
the subject of Government could not be
successfully studied apart from History, and
that it is a sort of poor relation to it on
which little time need be spent. The suggestion
of the Committee of Seven that the
subject might be taught in connection with
American History was adopted by a large
number of schools. The results obtained
are generally considered to be unsatisfactory.
In the West out of 240 schools heard
from, 153 were offering separate instruction
in Government, 47 taught the subject in
connection with History, and 40 failed to
specify the plan in use. The teachers or
principals in these schools personally preferred
the separate course by 158 to 30, 54
failing to commit themselves.</p>

<p>In the South 85 schools reported a separate
course in Government, 53 a combination
course with History. The teachers or
principals reporting preferred the separate
course by 111 to 33.</p>

<p>In the East and Mid-West 98 schools
reported a separate course on Government
and 74 a combination course. The teachers
or principals expressed a personal preference
for the separate course by 110 to 42.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the committee
divided the States into three more or less
arbitrary sections; the West, embracing all
the States west of the Mississippi, excepting
Missouri and the States to the south;
the South including all the States south of
the Ohio River and Mason and Dixon’s line
and east of the Mississippi, but including
Missouri and the States to the south; the
East and Mid-West including the States
east of the Mississippi and north of the
Ohio River line.</p>

<p>The reports from all the sections show
that experience is demonstrating that the
plan of teaching American Government and
American History as one subject is bad pedagogy
and false economy. The fact that
the teachers personally prefer the separate
course in Government by a large majority
in all three sections is significant. It
means that experience is a little ahead of
practice, and that when practice has caught
up with the best experience, the combination
course will be relegated to the scrap-heap
of discarded methods.</p>

<p>In its recommendations the committee
urges the need of more and better instruction
in Government, throughout the entire
school system from the fifth grade up.
There can be no question that improvements
in the administration of the government
have not kept pace with the advances,
for example, in industry, in commerce, in
transportation, or even in pure science. It
is a well-known fact that foreigners find
much to learn from this country in the
organization of industry and in the methods
of conducting business, but they do not
find so much to commend in the administration
of our governments. Yet it is in
this very field of politics and government
that this country was long supposed to
have completely outstripped all the older
countries. In the framing of constitutions
and in the inauguration of new systems of
popularizing political institutions America
has led and contributed much, but in the
careful, efficient management of public affairs
we have not been so successful. In
the management of our cities it is conceded
that our mistakes and failures are rather
more conspicuous than our successes. The
question naturally arises whether the public
schools have not contributed to these
mistakes and failures by neglecting to provide
adequate instruction in matters of
Government. It may be difficult to demonstrate
that school training in the science of
Government does result in purer political
methods and more efficient administration
of public business, but surely a citizenship
whose political information has been gleaned
from election posters, stump speeches, newspaper
head lines, and highly colored magazine
articles will not furnish a model of
civic enlightenment and success.</p>

<p>The duty of fitting the youth for the
services and responsibilities of citizenship
in the Republic under the complex conditions
which now prevail, belongs primarily
to the public school. It has not discharged
its highest function until it provides for
every child adequate instruction in the
government of this country. So far the
public school has failed to do this. There
are large cities in this country in which
no systematic instruction in Government is
given in the otherwise splendidly equipped
high schools, nor is the subject taught in
the grades. Some of these cities are in the
boss-ridden class. The question naturally
presents itself to our minds, is one circumstance
the cause of the other? Certainly
a high school, situated in a large city, that
does not lead its boys to study the complex
organization and functions of the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in which they live fails in performing
its first and highest duty.</p>

<p>The Committee of Five therefore recommends
that the instruction in Government
begin with the fifth grade. In the fifth,
sixth and seventh grades the subject should
be presented in general school exercises, in
the subjects selected for language lessons, in
connection with geography and other exercises.
In these grades the method of instruction
must be largely oral without a
text. Such topics as the fire department,
the police, the water works, the parks, garbage
collection, the health officer, the light
housekeeper, the life saving station suggest
subjects for discussion. The aim being to
lead the child to think of the community
and realize that it has rights, obligations,
property, that it does certain kinds of work
and that every individual citizen has a part
to play in the life and activities of this
community.</p>

<p>In the eighth grade more formal instruction
on local, State and national government
may be given. A simple text should
be selected, and this should be supplemented.
The main emphasis must be placed
on the study of local government to make
the subject concrete and bring it home.</p>

<p>The committee recommends that in the
high school Government be presented as a
distinct subject of instruction following one
semester of American History. At least
one-half year should be devoted to the subject
with five recitations per week or an
entire year where the three-recitation plan
is in use.</p>

<p>Some high schools are indeed devoting
an entire year to American Government
with excellent results. In fact, if the instruction
in all the high schools could be
brought up to the level of a few conspicuously
advanced schools the main desires
of the committee would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>In selecting a text the teacher should
avoid the old style manual, consisting of
the clauses of the constitution with comments.
Such books are entirely out of date.
They represent the first attempts at textbook
making in this field. They never were
good texts. It is rather surprising that
more than a score of high schools reporting
still use these useless books. The teacher
should equally avoid the new hybrid text
which attempts to combine in one, a treatment
of History and Government. In the
very nature of things such books must be
confusing and distracting to the beginner.</p>

<p>It is equally important that superintendents
and principals stop the practice of
assigning the subject to any teacher on the
force whose time is not fully taken up
with other duties. No one can hope to
teach Government with the best success
who has not a genuine interest and an
appropriate training for the work.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_27"></a>Lessons Drawn from the Papers of Candidates of the College Entrance Examination Board</h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY ELIZABETH BRIGGS, TEACHER OF HISTORY AND CIVIL GOVERNMENT IN SACHS’ SCHOOL FOR GIRLS, NEW YORK.</p>

<p>In studying the reports of the secretary
of the College Entrance Examination Board,
the history teacher learns the disheartening
fact that less than 60 per cent. of the
candidates in history get 60 per cent. or
over in the examinations. The proportion
of the whole number of candidates in history
who have received over 60 per cent.
for the past eight years is as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Proportion above 60%">
<tr><td>1902</td><td>1903</td><td>1904</td><td>1905</td><td>1906</td><td>1907</td><td>1908</td><td>1909</td></tr>
<tr><td>%</td><td>%</td><td>%</td><td>%</td><td>%</td><td>%</td><td>%</td><td>%</td></tr>
<tr><td>59.2</td><td>53.2</td><td>53.7</td><td>54</td><td>47.3</td><td>43.2</td><td>50.3</td><td>42.8<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It should be noted in passing that the
lessening number of successful candidates
characterizes not only history, but the
whole group of entrance examination subjects.
But further disquieting statistics
prove that history has generally fewer successful
candidates than most of the other
subjects; in 1907 it was surpassed in this
respect only by physics; in 1908, by German,
mathematics and zoölogy. Also in the
class of high ratings, 90-100, history comes
near the foot of the class; in 1907, all the
other subjects ranked higher except physics
and chemistry; in 1908, all except Spanish,
chemistry, botany, geography and music.
That is to say, history makes a poorer
showing than all the other large subjects,
those offering a thousand candidates or
more.</p>

<p>Granting that the demands of the examiners
are reasonable, history teachers must
conclude that the necessary equipment is
not being furnished to their pupils. Although
the questions are designed to test
something more than a superficial knowledge
of events, such a superficial knowledge,
provided it be complete as to the
whole field, would enable a candidate to
obtain a rating of 60. The papers of the
candidates are evidence that instruction has
been generally omitted on one point, and
has been slighted on three others.</p>

<p>In all conferences of history teachers,
much time is spent in considering how
best to inculcate historical mindedness,
accurate thought, cultivation of the imagination,
and clear reasoning; primarily it is
acknowledged that there must be acquired
a stock of definite information, but the
discussions seem to assume that the acquisition
of the information is an easy matter,
and that the exercise of observation,
analysis and judgment, may occupy the
greater part of the time of pupil and
teacher. In the classroom, however, both
teacher and pupil while trying to respond
to the multiplicity of demands have been
unable to divide the time into enough
fractions to go round, and the teachers
seem to have reached a consensus that the
topic to be crowded out shall be geography.
In spite of the fact that the requirements
in history state that geographical knowledge
will be tested by requiring the location
of places and movements on an outline
map, in spite of the fact that almost every
set of questions for nine years has demanded
map work, the papers of candidates
have shown that instruction in geography,
including the use of maps, has been
signally neglected. Year after year answers
in this subject have been marked uniformly
low, seldom attaining a passing
mark, being rated 1, 2 and 3, on a scale
of 10. In answers to questions which
asked that Philadelphia, Constantinople,
Alexandria, Delos and Delphi, be marked
on the map and their historical importance
be explained in the answer book, Philadelphia
was placed in North Dakota, Constantinople
in India, Alexandria on the
Adriatic, Delphi in Italy, and Delos near
Genoa; and yet the answer books told correctly
the historical importance of each.
How completely geography may be divorced
from map work was illustrated in a few
answers to a question that asked for the
marking on the map of the English frontier
on the European continent in the time
of William I, Henry II, and Henry V;
several candidates wrote out their answers
in addition to indicating them on the map,
with the curious result of a correct list and
an incorrect map, that is to say, the
memorizing of French provinces had been
carefully done, but there had been no practice
in map work. A more vicious example
of unintelligent memorizing it would be
hard to find. Countries as well as cities
have been misplaced; Ireland in Norway,
Wales in Germany, China in Egypt. That
the ignorance here is due to the teachers
and not to the pupils is made apparent by
the failure on this point in otherwise excellent
papers. There could have been no
instruction, or the intelligent pupil would
have met the requirement. Another proof
besides the mass of incorrect answers that
map work is neglected in the schools is the
fact that when the options permitted a
choice between map work and an explanation
of geographic control, the choice fell
on geographic control. This choice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
made not because the candidate was qualified
to write about the effect of geographical
conditions on the history of the early
settlements in America, or on the Revolutionary
struggle, but because guessing
seemed easy.</p>

<p>As for the other “eye of history,” chronology,
there is a respectable showing. The
examination questions have not asked for
lists of dates, though a knowledge of dates
has been frequently demanded by the
nature of the questions, and such demands
have not found the pupils wanting. An
occasional anachronism has occurred, and
has served to enliven the reading, as the
statements that the barons of the time of
William the Conqueror spent most of their
time smoking and drinking, and that Milton
was effective by means of his efforts in the
daily papers. Occasionally a candidate
would show what he could do by prefacing
or concluding his answer book with a
chronological table for the whole subject.</p>

<p>Answers to what may be called sweeping
questions such as “Trace the rise and fall
of the naval power of Athens,” show a lack
of practice in reviewing by topics; though
meagre, they suggest more acquaintance
with the subject than is written down, giving
evidence of considerable drill on isolated
points, if not on the continuous story. All
the history papers since 1901 have had
questions of this sort, and it would seem
likely that teachers would take the hint
and exercise their pupils in following a
train of events from reign to reign, from
administration to administration, from
century to century. The general failure
with this type of question and the general
success in timing isolated events leads to
the fear that the history is studied wholly
by reigns or administrations without regard
to the “ceaseless course” of Time.</p>

<p>The history examiners have also made a
point of introducing questions characterized
by their timeliness, about Alfred the Great
in the year when the thousandth anniversary
of his death was being celebrated, in
1904 on the Louisiana Purchase, in 1909 on
Grover Cleveland, questions which it was
expected would receive unusually full treatment.
The expectation was disappointed,
possibly because their “timeliness” did not
exist for the candidate; because current
events have had no share of his attention,
though they might be taking the form of
celebration of the past. As for current
events pure and simple, those that belong
to the present <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, any option on them
is avoided. The only subject of current
interest on which information has seemed
to be widespread was the melodramatic experience
of Miss Ellen Stone. Allied to
this ignorance of current events, is the
ignorance of the nineteenth century in
Modern history and in English history. A
candidate could write a passable account
of Charlemagne and fail on Bismarck, could
be accurate about Wolsey and yet state
that Gladstone wrote standard law books.
For this knowledge of the remote past and
ignorance of the recent present, Dr. James
Sullivan says that the text-books should
be held responsible, as few teachers are any
better than their text-books.</p>

<p>In biography, whenever the options made
it possible to write on several persons
rather than on one, the greater majority
of the candidates found it easier to present
a few meagre facts about several individuals
than an extended account of one individual.
Evidently biography in school is
confined to the foot notes or the descriptive
introductory paragraph on the page that
mentions a new leader for the first time.
In fact one student apologized for his limited
knowledge of Pitt and Nelson on the
ground that Montgomery gives no extended
biographies. Like Dr. Sullivan, he blamed
the text-book. It should not be implied
that the reader finds no evidence of collateral
reading. Indications of it do appear, but
they are rarer than oases in Sahara. Far
from hinting at collateral reading, many
answers showed inadequate attention to the
slender material offered in the text-book.
It seems not unreasonable to expect that
every student going up for examination in
English history should be able to place
Milton and Nelson correctly, yet their
names have brought out such statements as,
there is nothing recorded in history showing
any personal service that Milton did
for the Roundheads and that personally he
was a Tory, that Milton wrote books of
travel and wild improbable adventures of
sea and land; that Nelson explored for
England and went furthest north, that he
sunk the Spanish Armada, that he defeated
the combined French and Spanish
navies at Waterloo, and that he signaled,
“Don’t give up the ship.” The only satisfactory
item to be credited to these statements
is the fixed association of these
names respectively with literature and the
sea. Any hint as to the personality of the
subject is seldom found, yet William the
Conqueror, Henry VIII, and Cromwell,
seem to have had some hold on the imagination.</p>

<p>To summarize experiences as a reader is
not a happy task for the secondary school
teacher. As regards what may be termed
the New Learning in history&mdash;geographic
control, economics, and the exercise of observation,
analysis, and judgment, the
teacher need not blush at his failure to
render his pupil able to observe, analyze,
and judge in clear and correct English in
fifteen-minute sections of a two-hour examination,
or to deal successfully even in
an elementary way with subjects that have
either only recently become part of a college
course or are not generally studied by
freshmen. But what history teachers do
need to concern themselves with is the
failure to supply their pupils with a reliable
store of facts. If the statistics of the
Board seem to imply that history teaching
is inferior to teaching in most other subjects,
it would be consoling to accept the
suggestion that the poor returns are not
the result of poor teaching, but of no
teaching, since many candidates have tried
the examination without instruction, an experiment
they would make in no other subject.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_28"></a>The Study of Western History in Our Schools</h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY PROFESSOR CLARENCE W. ALVORD, OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.</p>

<p>The West has always been self-assertive.
This may sound somewhat banal, but no
adjective describes so exactly that principal
characteristic of her vigorous youth. Commercially,
politically, socially she has displayed
her egoism and has continually
demanded from her elder sister, the East,
praise for her achievements. Youth is,
however, passing away; over a century of
political life has been left behind; age has
brought with it a new pride in the consciousness
of accomplishment. To-day the
West realizes that she has had a history
that is no mean part of the national story.
The cry from the prairies is no longer:
“See what we are doing;” but, “See what
we have done.” Self-assertion again! Yes,
perhaps bumptiousness, but such is the
fact. On every side there are signs of this
new phase of western self-consciousness.
In no part of the Union is there such an
interest in local history. State-supported
departments of history, State historical
societies, county and city historical
societies, even women’s clubs and public
schools, and larger unions such as the confederation
of the societies of the Ohio Valley
and the Mississippi Valley Historical
Association, are all active in collecting
material for and exploiting western history.
Some of the efforts are misdirected,
many of the papers presented before these
learned societies are absurd; but even the
aimless gropings of the historical amœbæ
indicate the innermost yearnings for a
knowledge of the past and the consciousness
of deeds worth recording.</p>

<p>In developing this consciousness of her
past, the West, naturally enough, has found
a grievance against the historians of America
who have somewhat neglected this important
phase of the national development.
Before the eyes of the historian educated
under the shadow of the gilded dome of the
Puritan Capitol, the landing of the Pilgrim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Fathers looms larger on the historical
horizon than the occupation of the Old
Northwest during the Revolutionary War,
so that he gives a more careful and extensive
description to the former than to the
latter event. The westerner gazes upon
another horizon, where the relative importance
of events are differently grouped. To
him many events confined to New England,
the description of which fills pages of our
national histories, appear of local interest;
and events belonging to other parts of the
country assume national importance.</p>

<p>This grievance is not altogether fictitious,
as a glance at any of our large histories
and particularly at the text-books used in
our schools will disclose. The signs of the
times, however, point to a healthful change;
for in the last many-volumed American
history, chapter after chapter is devoted to
the history of the West. The correction of
the error in proportion, moreover, lies in
the hands of the western historians, who
can bring to prominence the events of their
section only by producing serious and scientific
studies on the development of the
West; and consciously or unconsciously the
recent movement in the study of western
history is directed toward that end. Besides
the popular interest in the subject,
already noted, the universities are turning
the attention of their graduate students to
the field; the scientifically-trained instructors
of these institutions are conducting
researches into the history of the valley; in
other words, western history is already
recognized as a legitimate field for research
work. Time alone is needed for the results
of this activity to become a part of the
national consciousness, when the relative
importance of western events will be correctly
given in our larger histories and be
finally disseminated through text-books and
popular works to the public.</p>


<h3>The Teacher’s Duty.</h3>

<p>The development of a popular knowledge
of the history of the West will largely be
the work of the teachers in our public
schools. This is fortunate, for the subject
is suited in a remarkable degree for the
purposes of instruction. In the great central
valley the romantic, religious, political,
and economic growths have been luxuriant,
and every student, whatever his character,
will find events to arouse his historical
imagination. The glamour around the wild
life of the forest and prairie appears most
brilliant to children. The lurking Indian,
the silent Jesuit, the song-loving <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageur</i>,
the hardy trapper&mdash;these are figures that
give a picturesque touch to our early history
which never fails to retain the attention
of the class.</p>

<p>Fortunately the earliest phase of western
history inspired the brilliant pen of Francis
Parkman, and his accounts of the discovery
and occupation of the Mississippi Valley
have become parts of the common
knowledge of our people, so that the figures
of Marquette, Lasalle, and Frontenac stand
out relatively clear in the memories of
the school days. Since, in Parkman’s
works, literature, romance, and good historical
narrative are so well combined, the
teacher should make the most of these, for
where he ends, there is no work or set of
works, comparable to his, to continue the
narrative.</p>

<p>Many have been the attempts to tell the
story of the advance of the English pioneers
across the mountains, but we still
await the well-equipped and inspired historian.
There are, of course, books to which
the pupils can turn with profit and interest.
Particularly has the frontiersman with gun
and axe been glorified, and his picturesque
figure is fully as attractive as Jesuit priest
or French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageur</i>. But the fundamental
motives of the westward movement should
not be lost in the romantic story of a
Boone or Sevier. The first impulse westward
came from the Englishman’s desire to
participate in the fur trade which the
French threatened to monopolize. During
the reign of Charles II the movement, extending
from Hudson Bay to the Carolinas,
was started. Almost as early as Lasalle,
Virginians were on the waters of the Upper
Ohio, and were trading among the Indians
of the Southwest. The fight for the fur
trade had begun.</p>

<p>Land speculation was a second impulse
for the westward movement. Boom towns
were not an invention of yesterday. The
far-famed American pioneer played his part
in these enterprises, but he was often only
a pawn in the hands of the gentleman speculator
of the East, who is to be found in
every period of western development. The
speculative energy of such men as George
Washington, the Lees, and George Morgan
advertised the advantages of the valley
lands far and wide. Then followed the
wild rush of homeseekers which rapidly
built the Western States.</p>

<p>The story of the West in the Revolutionary
War is not well told in the usual text-books
of the schools, for the description of
the events which decided whether this vast
territory should be British or Spanish or
belong to the United States are generally
relegated to a few lines of a paragraph.
The settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee,
the occupation of the Old Northwest by the
Virginians, the successful campaigns of Governor
Galvez which gave the Floridas to
Spain, the defeat of the various British
campaigns to recover their hold on the central
Mississippi; these are all events of
stupendous importance for the future development
of the American people.</p>


<h3>Western Tendencies.</h3>

<p>The first and most marked characteristic
in the history of the West is its unity.
This sets it off from the East, where particularistic
development was the rule. On
the seaboard, well marked peculiarities separate
the inhabitants of the different sections.
In the Mississippi Valley, State
boundaries have little meaning, and divide
in no way the people living on either side.
Even when broader areas than those of the
States are considered, diverse development
is not so well marked as it is east of the
mountains. Throughout the early pioneer
period the emigration westward was the
same in character north and south of
Mason and Dixon’s line. The Ohio River
was the great channel by which the tide
of immigration flowed over the prairies of
the Old Northwest and the blue grass region
of Kentucky; and accident frequently
led one man to the slave-holding States and
his neighbor to the North.</p>

<p>If the Ohio was the gateway to the West,
the Mississippi was the great central avenue
upon which the western people from
all sections met in friendly trade, so that
the original feeling of solidarity was
strengthened by continuous intercourse and
the realization of mutual interests. The
different environment at the headwaters
and mouth of the river never succeeded in
separating completely the western people.
Here the idea of the unity of the country
took deeper root than in the East, where
statehood meant more and nation less. It
was in the Middle West that, as the struggle
between North and South drew near,
national leaders were developed and where
the strongest efforts were made to hold the
country in unity.</p>


<h3>Western Democracy.</h3>

<p>The West has moulded our national character
even more than New England with
her far-famed and narrow Puritanism; for
the West has been the cauldron into which
the nations of the world have poured their
streams of immigrants and from which has
come the national type. This amalgamation
of character began in the oldest West,
when Irishmen, Englishmen, Scotch-Irish,
and Germans settled in the region between
the falls of the seaboard rivers and the
mountains, stretching from Vermont to
Georgia. Here was moulded the new type
of man, who was to populate the greater
West across the mountain ridges. In an
environment of primeval conditions, in the
struggle with the Indians and the forests
there was developed a self-reliance of character,
differing in many ways from any
single European type. This new man of
the West admired the doer of deeds, condemned
all reliance on traditional or family
position, scorned State authority, and
loved independence. In the soil of the new
West, created by these men, the doctrines
of Rousseau flourished luxuriantly. All unconscious,
the frontiersmen were putting
into practice the most radical philosophy of
the French Revolution. It was on the frontier
that those conservative traditions of
Europe, which lingered years afterwards in
the more settled East, were swept away,
and American democracy was really bred.
It was on the border of the older frontier
that the spokesman of this democracy,
Thomas Jefferson, lived; and it was out of
the new West that the hero of democracy,
Andrew Jackson, came.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_30"></a>The Newest State Association and an Older One</h2>


<h3>THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HISTORY TEACHERS.</h3>

<p class="authorindent">BY H. W. EDWARDS, OF BERKELEY.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the California
Association of History Teachers was held
in Berkeley, July 14, in connection with
the summer session of the University of
California. The following papers were
read:</p>

<p>“History in the Grammar School”&mdash;J. B.
Newell, University of California.</p>

<p>“Emphasis in Ancient History”&mdash;R. F.
Scholz, University of California.</p>

<p>“Emphasis in Teaching of History”&mdash;Roger
B. Merriman, Harvard University.</p>

<p>Prof. Newell urged that in the grades,
history be taught with more attention to
the great fundamental facts and elimination
of details. He considered that great
contests, such as the American Revolution,
should be used by the teacher to train the
pupil in a broad tolerance, by calling attention
to the merits of both sides of the
question. He would have the teachers do
more reading for themselves, and called
attention to the need of more money for
providing the schools with books.</p>

<p>The burden of Prof. Scholz’s essay was
the neglect of the Orient as a constant
factor in Ancient History. Many teachers
and most text-books assume that the East
ceased to exert a great influence after the
time of Alexander. This tendency to divide
Ancient History into “compartments” ignores
the solidarity of the ancient world,
and is essentially unscientific. Oriental
influence was a powerful element throughout
the whole of the ancient period. In
conclusion Prof. Scholz called attention to
certain parallels between the race questions
of antiquity and those of the present day.</p>

<p>Prof. Merriman made four principal
points:</p>

<p class="numberitem1">1. Make history interesting&mdash;“better be
flippant than dull.”</p>

<p class="numberitem1">2. Compare and correlate. Example&mdash;the
date 1492 becomes increasingly significant
when one considers Lorenzo de Medici,
Charles VIII of France, the conquest of
Granada, Pope Alexander VI.</p>

<p class="numberitem1">3. Relate the past to modern events and
conditions.</p>

<p class="numberitem1">4. Make the development of mental
power a constant purpose.</p>

<p>In addition to these papers, two short
talks were given. Prof. J. N. Bowman narrated
the origin of the Pacific Coast
Branch of the American Historical Association,
and urged the claims of both parent
Association and Branch.</p>

<p>Dr. S. H. Willey, a member of the California
Constitutional Convention of 1849,
and the first President of the University
of California, was present, and was called
upon by the chairman. To the history
teachers, it was most interesting to listen
to one who had done much to make history,
and to hear of the birth of the State
from one of her “fathers.” Dr. Willey
gave an interesting account of the conditions
leading up to the convention, and
of the making and adoption of the Constitution,
together with references to the great
struggle in Congress. He urged that the
children of the State be made familiar with
the facts of her history, and expressed a
hope that the teachers would devote more
attention to the subject.</p>

<p>The officers of the Association are:</p>

<h3>THE HISTORY TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION OF MARYLAND.</h3>

<p class="authorindent">BY DR. ELEANOR L. LORD,
Professor of History in Woman’s College,
Baltimore.</p>

<p>The organization of the Maryland Association
can hardly be described as the result
of spontaneous enthusiasm or of voluntary
action on the part of the teachers themselves;
rather, it was somewhat in the
nature of an experiment in historiculture
undertaken by request. There are reasons,
partly geographical, partly economic and
partly political, it may be, why many
of the history teachers, especially in the
rural districts of Maryland, working a little
apart from the main currents of educational
progress, need an awakening or a lift or
both.</p>


<h4>The Origin.</h4>

<p>At the annual meeting of the Association
of History Teachers of the Middle States
and Maryland, in 1905, the difficulty everywhere
experienced in reaching teachers who
are prevented by duties or by geographical
remoteness from attending the conventions
was pointed out, and it was voted to
authorize and encourage the foundation of
local conferences of history teachers, with
a view to minimizing the obstacles to closer
contact with the more remote teachers and
stimulating interest in local history and
in local problems. The primary purpose of
these local organizations was declared to be
the same as that of the main association,
viz., “to advance the study and teaching
of history and government through discussion,”&mdash;a
wider discussion than is possible
at the annual meeting. Mr. Robert H.
Wright, of Baltimore, who was present at
the meeting, was requested to attempt the
formation of a local association for Baltimore.
A few weeks later, as the result of
a conference of five individuals interested
in the matter, an invitation was extended
to a number of local teachers and students
of history to attend a meeting in the Donovan
Room, Johns Hopkins University, the
very room, as it happened, in which the
Association of History Teachers of the
Middle States and Maryland was organized.
This meeting, held May 19, 1906, was well
attended. The objects of the proposed
association were stated and a temporary
organization effected. It was voted to extend
the geographical scope of the association
so as to include the State of Maryland
as well as Baltimore City. The constitution
subsequently adopted stated the purpose
of the association to be, in addition
to the objects already mentioned, the promotion
of personal acquaintance among
teachers and students of history, and, as
far as practicable, the furtherance of the
interests of the main association.</p>


<h4>Progress of the Association.</h4>

<p>The Maryland Association has made fair
progress in the three years of its existence.
The membership, numbering at present
about thirty-five, includes university, college,
normal, high and elementary school
teachers of history, as well as school superintendents
and supervisors.</p>

<p>The activities of the Association may be
summarized briefly. Since the date of
organization seven regular meetings have
been held and the following subjects have
been discussed:</p>

<p>“Historical Aspects of the United States
Navy,” by Hon. Charles J. Bonaparte, Secretary
of the Navy.</p>

<p>“Fundamental Principles in Teaching
History,” by Prof. Charles M. Andrews,
Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>“The Best Methods of Controlling and
Testing the Students’ Work in History,” by
Principal R. H. Wright, Eastern High
School for Girls, and Prof. Eleanor L. Lord,
Woman’s College of Baltimore.</p>

<p>“The Correlation of History and Geography,”
by Miss Elizabeth Montell, Teachers’
Training School.</p>

<p>“The Correlation of History and English,”
by Miss Annette Hopkins, Teachers’
Training School.</p>

<p>“Essentials in Teaching History,” by
Supervising Principal H. M. Johnson,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>“Sources of American History in the
British Archives,” by Prof. C. M. Andrews,
Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>“Public Libraries as an Aid to Students
and Teachers of History,” by Dr. Bernard
Steiner, Librarian of Enoch Pratt Free
Library.</p>

<p>“Management of Collateral Reading in
Connection with the Text-Book,” by Miss
Annie Graves, Arundell School, and Miss
Florence Hoyt, Bryn Mawr School.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1907-08 a study section
for the study of civics was successfully
carried on by Mr. Robert H. Wright. The
most ambitious work undertaken has been
the compilation of an Annotated Bibliography
for the Use of History Teachers. The
task was intrusted to Prof. C. M. Andrews,
Mr. J. Montgomery Gambrill and Miss Lida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Lee Tall. The Bibliography was published
in instalments in the “Atlantic Educational
Journal,” through the courtesy of the editors,
and it will shortly appear in permanent
form.</p>

<p>When the Association of History Teachers
of the Middle States and Maryland met
in Baltimore, in March, 1908, the local association
acted, in a sense, as hosts. On this
occasion a Guide to Points of Historical
Interest in Baltimore was compiled for the
local association by Dr. Annie H. Abel and
Dr. Eleanor L. Lord, and copies were distributed
to the members of the visiting
association.</p>


<h4>Ideals of the Founders.</h4>

<p>In planning the work of the Association,
the Executive Board has always had in
view the fact that not only the general
meetings of the main association, but even
those of the local conference, are beyond
the reach of many who may feel the need
of information about matters that closely
concern persons engaged in the teaching of
history; the stimulus of contact with
others teaching the same subject; the enrichment
of their own minds through a
fresh study of the subject in the light of
recent scholarship. Repeated efforts have
been made by means of circular letters to
elicit suggestions of means of making the
Association useful to its more remote members;
and all members have been urged to
join, individually, the Association of the
Middle States and Maryland, in order that
they may receive its publications and those
of the New England and North Central
Associations. Thirteen new members were
added to the main association during the
year 1908-09. An effort is now being made
to improve the library facilities of teachers
in the rural districts; and the co-operation
of the State Library Commission of
Maryland has been promised in an effort
to circulate through the county high schools
traveling book-boxes, selected according to
the classification of the Bibliography mentioned
above.</p>

<p>The officers for 1908-09 were as follows:</p>

<p>President&mdash;Eleanor L. Lord.</p>

<p>Vice-President&mdash;Charles M. Andrews.</p>

<p>Secretary-Treasurer&mdash;Robert H. Wright.</p>

<p>Additional Members of the Board of
Governors&mdash;Lida Lee Tall, J. Montgomery
Gambrill.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_31"></a>An Ancient History Character Social</h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY MARY NORTH, MONTCLAIR, N. J.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty boys and girls in
the first-year class of a suburban high
school planned and carried through a most
successful review in Ancient History last
May. The course provides for five periods
a week (one of which is unprepared), and
it covers Oriental History as well as Greek
and Roman. The pupils had exhibited
much interest during the year, but were
beginning to show signs of listlessness and
fatigue, and something had to be done to
arouse their enthusiasm. A character
social was suggested by the teacher, and
more was accomplished by it than could
have been gained by weeks of urging and
toil.</p>

<p>Each division appointed a committee to
assist in the preparations, and by the time
that the affair was over more than half of
the pupils had taken an active part in the
arrangements. Besides committees on program,
printing, refreshments and decorating,
there were special groups at work.
Several boys busied themselves making
siege machinery such as the Romans used,
while some of the girls dressed small dolls
to represent Roman soldiers. All of these
models were exact and required much study
and skill on the part of the makers. The
much-talked-of theory of co-ordination was
put into practice, for the Latin department
provided accounts and pictures of sieges,
while the manual-training teachers allowed
the boys the use of the shop. Another set
of pupils planned an exhibition of statuary,
preparing garments and studying poses of
famous classic statues.</p>

<p>The first number on the program was the
exhibition of the siege machinery. On the
platform were a city wall and tower built
of wooden blocks, and before them,
arranged for the attack, were many pieces
of machinery. The boys who made the
machines had charge of the siege, and each
exhibited his instrument, giving its name
and explaining its mechanism. There were
catapults, ballistæ, battering-rams, vineæ,
plutei, tre-buckets, wall-hooks and besieging
towers. The chairman of the committee
explained the grouping of the machines
on the field and the relative importance of
the various instruments, and then the siege
began. Each machine actually worked, and
the city wall collapsed. On a table near by
the legates, slingers and centurions witnessed
the siege, but took no active part.
They were very properly clad, but their
flaxen locks and gentle eyes belied their
warlike apparel.</p>

<p>Another part of the platform had been
arranged for the exhibition of statuary and
was fronted by a large picture-frame illuminated
by electricity. When the curtain
was first drawn there stood in the frame
the famous “Mourning Athena,” recently
found in the ruins of the Parthenon. The
Gracchi next appeared and were followed
by a vestal virgin, who gave place to two
lictors. The last statue was Minerva
Giustiniani, perhaps the most successful of
all. It had taken the combined efforts of
many pupils to produce helmet, serpent and
spear, so that all were vitally interested in
this statue. Her pose and expression were
perfect, and the silence which greeted her
was intense until broken by deafening
applause.</p>

<p>The early numbers on the program were
most interesting, but did not compare with
the character social itself. Each person on
arriving had been tagged with a number
and had communicated to a trusty official
the name of the character that he had
chosen. These characters could be taken
from the Oriental monarchies as well as
from Greece and Rome. They must, however,
have been mentioned in the text-books
(Myers and Morey). Each player
was provided with a pencil and printed program
containing a list of numbers corresponding
to those of the characters present.
At a given signal the game began, and each
assumed his character. No one told his
name, but each talked or acted as if he
were Cæsar, or Alexander, or Rameses. As
soon as a boy discovered that he was talking
to Cæsar, he would scribble down
“Cæsar” opposite the proper number and
rush off to talk to same one else. One boy
wore a double-faced mask and carried little
gates; another had a tiny pair of boots
pinned to his coat and carried in his hand
a beautiful toy horse. A girl carried a lantern
and anxiously searched the faces of all
her comrades; her quest seemed fruitless,
and she would sadly shake her head and
move on. Every mind was hard at work,
and at the end of the hour it was with difficulty
that the room was brought to order
to compare characters with the original list.</p>

<p>The correct list of characters was read,
and all who had guessed over seventy were
invited to the platform. No one responded
to the descending numbers called until
sixty was reached, when one girl came up.
Then others followed in increasing numbers
until the faculty began to respond in the
thirties. The quiet and suspense during
this calling off of numbers was most intense.
Of course, no one had conversed
with each character present, but many
players guessed correctly all the characters
they had met.</p>

<p>For days after the social this character-study
continued, because the boys and girls
kept going over in their minds the characters
they had met and not guessed, and
kept comparing notes until the list of characters
they knew was greatly increased.
When the real review came in class, the
pupils discovered that scarcely a period
could be found that had not been touched
upon, while the teacher had again secured
an enthusiastic group of students instead
of numberless indifferent boys and girls.</p>

<h3><a id="Ref_32"></a>METHOD THE NEED.</h3>

<p>Printed on another page of this number
is a paper by Miss Briggs upon her experiences
as an examiner and reader in history
for the College Entrance Examination
Board, in which figures are given to show
that history papers are rated lower than
any other of the major subjects, and that
the average grade in history, instead of rising,
is actually getting lower year by year.
Miss Briggs expresses the hope that the low
grades are due to the number of applicants
who prepare by rapid tutoring or wholly
by themselves for the history examinations;
a practice, of course, almost impossible in
the other major subjects. But while such
cramming is partly responsible for the failure
of history applicants, it cannot relieve
the history teacher of blame. All who have
had experience in the marking of history
papers in entrance examinations know that
much of the teaching of history is careless,
indefinite, and without evident purpose or
understanding. If our subject is not to lose
caste altogether we must find a method
which will give the student that which can
be measured objectively, as well as furnish
subjective satisfaction or culture.</p>

<p>Such a method will not add to the intricacy
of history for the student, but it will
require more efficient teachers of the subject,
and it will prevent that serious evil
of the high school teaching of history,&mdash;the
assignment of history to any unattached instructor,
whether he or she knows anything
about history or no. History teaching in
the college or the graduate school has, to a
certain extent, found itself, and won the respect
of its fellows; history teaching in the
high school and preparatory school has not
yet reached that point of self-development.</p>

<p>There has been much talk, and rightfully,
about the content of secondary school history
courses. The market has been filled
with excellent text-books and admirable
source books&mdash;indeed they are almost too
good in that they have made text-book recitations
easier and somewhat more interesting.
There have been pages and volumes of
reading references and map references and
source references. Yet with all these aids to
the better teaching of history there has not
gone a proportionate ability to use them.
Let us ask for a while, not what period of
history shall we teach? but, how shall we
teach any period of history?</p>

<p>In the Latin or Greek class there are
objective standards which must be reached;
in the mathematics or the English class
there is a certain amount and quality of
productive work to be accomplished; in the
physics or chemistry or botany class there
is laboratory experience to be gained and
recorded in note-books. Has history a
method which can be compared with any of
these? Can we measure objectively the
student’s acquisition? Can we get him to
use in some way his experiences in the field
of history, or have him record them in a
valuable form?</p>

<p>It may be objected that the establishment
of a more intricate historical method will
add to the duties and labor of the history
teacher. This may be true; and indeed
ought to be true. The day ought to have
passed when a college graduate who took
in college but one course in history, and
that in Oriental history, should be thought
qualified to teach history in a secondary
school. Such cases are not rare to-day;
they would be rarer if the historical method
were more definite and required better
training.</p>

<p>Professor Fling’s article in the September
<span class="smcap">Magazine</span> and Professor Trenholme’s articles
in this and subsequent numbers will
furnish some details of historical method
which should be valuable to every history
teacher. In carrying out these suggestions
the teacher may temporarily add to his or
her own labors; but this will not be for
long. Added efficiency will mean greater
respect for the teacher and the subject; and
increased respect will bring more assistants
in history, more time devoted to the subject,
and incidentally a stronger demand for good
history teachers. Economically as well as
intellectually the history teacher will profit
by raising the standards of his profession.</p>


<h3>“AS HIRELING AND NOT AS CONSECRATE.”</h3>

<p>A noted journalist, who is also a writer
on educational topics, and a trustee of a
large eastern university, in writing to the
editor respecting the establishment of <span class="smcap">The
History Teacher’s Magazine</span>, said: “Your
idea is an admirable one. It ought to do
good.... With this teaching, as with all
others, I fear the difficulty is the spirit in
which it is done, as hireling and not as
consecrate.”</p>

<p>Is this charge true of the history teachers
of the country? We know that history
teachers were among the last to organize
for common purposes; that to-day their
associations are not as strong as those of
teachers of the classics and of other subjects,
that their class work is not as well
organized as the work of that far more
indefinite subject, secondary school English.
Are these facts the result of a hireling
spirit? We think not. Rather they are
due to the unfortunate place which until
very recent years, history has occupied in
the elementary and secondary school roster.
And yet, while we believe there existed
and still exist valid impediments to the
greatest success of the history teacher, it
may be well for each of us to ask himself
or herself the question. Am I doing the
work as hireling and not as consecrate? At
times we need such searching questions.
And until the time when we have a great
body of history teachers who are teaching
the subject because they love it and love
to teach it to others our history teaching
will be heartless and sterile.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_33"></a>European History in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorindent">D. C. KNOWLTON, PH.D., Editor.</p>

<p class="center boldfont mediumfont">THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE MEDIEVAL EMPIRE.</p>


<h3>The Importance of the Church.</h3>

<p>The problem of simplifying and of unifying
the material for study so as to give
the student a clear conception of the course
of European development is one that confronts
the teacher at every turn and calls
constantly for solution. In this connection
Professor Emerton, in his address on the
“Teaching of Medieval History in the
Schools,” points out the importance of the
study of the Church as the great unifying
element in European progress, especially
throughout the Middle Ages. “All the peoples
of Europe, divided as they are by
nationalities and by social classes, are all
united in this one common possession of
religion and a culture derived from Rome
and holding them still after generations of
separation in an ideal attachment to something
they feel to be higher and better than
anything in their present world.” The aims
of the papacy in particular, says Professor
Emerton, make this task of the teacher
easier of solution, because the successors
of St. Peter, even harking back to the times
of Gregory I, strove one and all for the
same end&mdash;“to enforce anew this ideal of
a vast Christian State, governed in the last
resort by an appeal to its own divinely-constituted
tribunal.” The greatest efforts
put forth to this end fall within the period
under consideration, namely from the times
of Hildebrand to the death of Frederick II,
or, more exactly, from about 1050, when
Hildebrand was fast becoming the power
behind the papal throne, to 1268, when Conradin’s
untimely death in the market place
of Naples terminated the rule of the
Hohenstaufen.</p>

<p>The presentation of the relations between
the popes and the emperors of this period
involves a fourfold task, namely an appreciation
(1) of the time covered and the
areas concerned, (2) the personalities involved,
(3) the issues at stake, and (4)
the effects of the struggle on Europe.</p>


<h3>The Elements of Time and Place.</h3>

<p>It may be an elementary consideration,
but it is withal fundamental, that the pupil
grasp the length of time involved, the order
in which the events occurred, and the theater
on which they transpired. It is not a
continuous struggle, for it is opened, then
closed, then reopened again; now by pope,
now by emperor. On the other hand these
successive meetings of popes and emperors
in conflict are but phases of one and the
same great struggle for supremacy, whose
issue Professor Emerton has so clearly
stated. These phases must be clearly defined
as to their time limits if the student
is to follow the contest intelligently. As to
the countries or localities involved he must
understand what was meant by the Holy
Roman Empire of the German people and
what its limits were, both actual and theoretical;
to which he must add a more detailed
knowledge of Italy, particularly of
Lombardy and the new Norman kingdom in
the South, which proved to be such an important
factor in the situation.</p>


<h3>The Personalities in the Struggle.</h3>

<p>In no period of the Middle Ages can we
find personalities more striking than those
zealous upholders of the papal prerogative,
Gregory VII and Innocent III&mdash;a statement
which applies equally well to the great
champions of the empire, Frederick I and
Frederick II. Frederick Barbarossa attained
his exalted position when scarcely thirty;
his illustrious namesake at an even earlier
age. Both therefore entered the contest
with all the vigor and enthusiasm of their
young manhood. Although Gregory VII and
Innocent III were somewhat farther advanced
in life, they too had lost none of
their youthful ardor and enthusiasm
as they had risen rapidly to high position,
the one becoming papal counsellor before
he was thirty, the other elected pope at
thirty-eight. These men represent some of
the best products of their times, in character,
physique, scholarly attainments and
native ability. Frederick II even foreshadows
in character rulers like Henry VIII and
Louis XI, who lived more than two centuries
later.</p>

<p>Alike in some respects, what contrasts
they present in others. So faithfully have
the chroniclers performed their tasks that
it is comparatively easy to call them up and
make them pass in review before us. Hildebrand,
unimposing in appearance, but passionate
and indomitable; Henry IV, intelligent,
but violent; the tall, fair-haired,
princely Barbarossa; the thin, but well-proportioned,
Frederick II, of studious mien;
and finally the majestic Innocent III, now
giving way to bursts of anger, and now
plunged into fits of deep melancholy. The
principles which these men represented
could not have had better advocates.</p>


<h3>The Issues.</h3>

<p>An examination of the three main struggles
shows that each of these champions of
Church and State hoped to realize a definite
aim which he usually sought to attain in
his own way. It is most interesting to follow
the ebb and flow of the tide of battle.
The pope was the first to throw down the
gage of battle by attempting to remove
the Church from politics through the suppression
of simony and the marriage of the
clergy. The very boldness of Gregory in
daring to alter conditions which had not
been disturbed for generations, and that,
too, in the face of the strongest opposition,
calls forth not only surprise, but admiration,
which increases as we examine the
forces upon which he relied to accomplish
his results, namely, the canon law, the
church organization and the ban of excommunication.
According to some authorities,
the very year which witnessed the settlement
of the first great struggle (1122),
marked the birth of Frederick I, the second
great champion of the rights of the empire,
rightly named the imperialist Hildebrand.
Selecting Charlemagne as his model, he
strove not only to unify his German possessions,
but to re-establish the power and
authority of the empire in Europe by reasserting
its right to rule Rome and the Lombard
cities, and by endeavoring to unite
with it the Norman possessions in the
south of Italy. These attempts naturally
brought him into conflict with
the papacy, which feared so dangerous
a neighbor on its very borders. His main
reliance was in the recently-revived study
of the Roman law, and in a his labors he
governed himself by the maxim that “all
that pleases a prince has the force of law.”
Innocent III, with perhaps the highest conception
of his position of any individual
who had thus far occupied the chair of St.
Peter, dared to assert that the Lord gave
that apostle the rule not only of the Universal
Church, but also the rule of the whole
world. That these were not mere phrases
on his lips was shown by his efforts to
extend his authority to the furthest bounds
of Christendom. Favored somewhat by circumstances,
he became for a time the
arbiter of the destinies of the empire, but
at no time did he have a foeman worthy of
his steel within its confines. These were
rather to be found in the limits of Christendom
in the rising kingdoms of France and
England, whose sovereigns nevertheless
trembled before his threats and repented of
their misdeeds. Like Gregory VII, he asked
for no stronger weapons than the terrors
inspired by the wrath of Mother Church.
Finally there appeared in the arena the
brilliant ward of this the greatest of popes,
Frederick II, aptly characterized as the first
of modern kings, striving for absolute mastery
in Sicily and in Germany, placing his
trust, as did his illustrious ancestor in the
Roman law, but utilizing at the same time
his knowledge of men and the rising power
of the bourgeoisie. His plans, like those of
Barbarossa, met with vigorous opposition at
the hands of the popes and for much the
same reasons.</p>


<h3>Effects of the Struggle.</h3>

<p>When we pass to our final consideration,
namely, the effects of these struggles on
their participants and upon Europe, we find
ourselves face to face with incidents of a
most dramatic character. The scene at
Canossa is the most familiar of these, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
there was also the no less humiliating spectacle
later at the portals of St. Mark’s in
Venice, when Frederick Barbarossa sought
a reconciliation with Alexander III, followed
almost a hundred years later by the
tragic end of the last of the Hohenstaufen.
These events, dramatic as they appear,
serve rather to mark the progress of the
long struggle than as epitomes of its
results. These must be sought in the relative
position and influence of the Church
and empire in Europe at the end of the
period. Although both reached the apogee
of their power and influence during this
period, the middle of the thirteenth century
marks the period of their decline. This
decay was more marked at first in the case
of the empire, which practically ceased to
exist in name. The time, however, was not
far distant when the papacy, too, was to
enter the valley of humiliation and drink
to the dregs the bitter cup which it had put
to the lips of its great adversary. “One
generation more and the same nation which
had sent an army to defend its cause in
Italy was to strike it in the face with the
iron glove of one of its own subjects, and
was then to capture it and hold it, an ignominious
tool for political ends during a century
more.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These facts, with a more detailed
statement of the various symptoms
of decay, should be impressed upon the
student as the teacher brings the period to
a close.</p>


<h3>Literature.</h3>

<p>The account of the three phases of the
struggle as given by Grant in his “Outlines
of European History,” is especially to be
recommended for its brevity, clearness, simplicity
and comprehensiveness; also Chapter
X in Adams’s “Civilization During the Middle
Ages,” which summarizes the struggle
from a slightly different standpoint. Portraits
of the main actors are to be found
in Bemont and Monod’s “Medieval Europe
from 395 to 1270”; Tout, “Empire and
Papacy,” and Emerton, “Medieval Europe”
(814-1300). These books are also valuable
for their details of the struggle. There is
abundant source material in Robinson, Ogg,
and Thatcher and McNeal to make clear the
attitude of the popes, notably of Gregory
VII and the various treaties and compromises
which mark the different stages of
the struggle. In some cases contemporary
accounts are given of the struggle itself,
e. g., of the scene at Canossa. In this connection
mention might be made of the description
of this scene by Dr. Jaeger as an
illustration of the narrative method of presentation
as employed by the German
schoolmaster.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h2><a id="Ref_34"></a>English History in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorindent">C. B. NEWTON, Editor.</p>

<p class="center boldfont mediumfont">II. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENGLISH NATION; TO EDWARD I.</p>


<h3>Feudalism: One Way to Get at It.</h3>

<p>It seems to me better not to grapple with
feudalism until the rage of the Conquest is
fairly passed, and we come to the actual
reign of William I, partly because we have
our hands full before this in trying to instil
a reasonably clear idea of the Saxon forms
of government, and partly because it is not
very clear just how early feudal forms and
customs began to be disseminated throughout
England. So we may as well merely
mention their existence before the Norman
régime, and not explain them fully till we
are called on to show what modification in
the continental system was made by the
Conqueror.</p>

<p>The feudal system is so difficult to define
briefly that most text-books evade the
attempt to do so. I believe, however, in
introducing even so large a subject as this
with a terse definition, such, for example,
as: “Feudalism was a method of land ownership
and government common throughout
Europe during the middle ages.” It does
a boy or girl no harm to learn a short
statement like this, even though it means
little to him or her at first. It serves as a
rallying point for explanation; its terms
are pegs on which to hang further details
in orderly fashion. To explain more concretely
just what I mean, suppose we take
the above definition (any other would do),
and see how we may proceed with it in the
class room so as to light it up with real
meaning.</p>

<p>A, let us say, has recited the definition
glibly, having taken it down in his note-book
the day before, with instructions to
learn it by heart. “Now, A,” says the
astute teacher, “do you understand what
that means?” “Not exactly,” hesitates A,
if he is ingenuous (if he isn’t, he may
easily be confounded). “Good!” you reply,
in one stroke commending his honesty and
showing that you do not expect bricks
without straw. “Let’s see if we can’t get
at its meaning. Does your father own any
land?” (A surprised look and pricking up
of ears in the class). “No? Well, he rents
your home, then? Yes? But somebody
owns it, of course, and how did he get it?
Bought it? Probably. Do you know of
any way of getting land except by buying
or renting it?” Voice from an excited
hand across the room, “How about wills?”
“Yes, land may be inherited, but it had
to be bought once, didn’t it?” “Well,”
you continue, to A and the class, “this
buying or renting for money is our ‘method
of land ownership,’ do you see? Now, did
you ever hear of a man’s being in Congress,
or the legislature, or being a judge simply
because he owned or rented a certain
amount of land? Certainly not. Men are
elected or appointed to places in our government.
Land ownership and government
are separate matters. Just think how different
it was in old England (and throughout
Europe, for that matter) in feudal
times. Men held high position in the nation
largely because of their great estates
together with their prowess in war. Now,
instead of buying or renting land, how
would your landlord or your father have
got it, say in the reign of William I, A?”
“From the king or from some big noble.”
“Right you are&mdash;but how, for nothing?”
“No, in return for fighting for him.” “Yes,
and on a few other conditions; they are
given in your book. What were they, X?
What! asleep? Forgotten? C, tell us.”
So you proceed to draw out the details of
homage, fealty, and service, the theory of
royal ownership, the terms suzerain, vassal,
fief, etc., drilling in the unfamiliar words
by frequent use, comparing them as far as
possible with present terms and usages, and
bringing out, by contrast and comparison,
the essentials of the whole system. Finally
you show that the system was universal
throughout Christendom, explain what the
middle ages were (if A, C or X can’t), and
point out the adaptability of feudalism to
the time. When you have finished this,
your period will have flown (lucky if the
bell does not ring too soon!), and your
mere definition will mean something to all
but your dullest pupils. On pp. 131-136 of
Cheyney’s “Readings,” are some excellent
practical details of feudal procedure
which will be found useful for examples.</p>


<h3>A Logical Approach to the Origins of the Jury.</h3>

<p>Did you ever stop to think how little
your intelligent pupil understands about
some present-day institutions the origins
of which interest us because we
appreciate their modern practice and
significance? Take, for example, the jury.
A little questioning will bring out whether
or not your class knows the difference between
a trial jury and a grand jury, either
in make-up or in functions. Unless you
are more fortunate than I have been, you
will find they know very little. Now, does
it not seem an illogical absurdity to wade
right into the beginnings of the jury system
in the days of Henry II when our
class has little or no notion of what the
system is now, or what it stands for?
When we come to this point, therefore, in
the epoch-making reign of King Henry II,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
it is pertinent and profitable to digress into
a clear discussion of the jury of to-day,
bringing out what knowledge we can find
in the class, and adding to it by some such
Socratic method of question and answer as
we may have used in connection with
feudalism, rather than by giving a “talk”
on the subject. After paving the way in
this fashion, we may start in with the
Assize of Clarendon. (Cheyney’s “Readings”
pp. 141-142) and the distinction between
recognitors and presentment, so we
shall emphasize the essential facts, and also
bring out both the similarity and the difference
between the germ and the present fruit
of this ancient method of arriving at justice.</p>


<h3>Some Great Personalities.</h3>

<p>I think it is helpful to the memory, and
useful, because of the great influence of the
crown throughout English History, to bring
out the <em>personality</em> of <em>every</em> sovereign, so
that the names of each dynasty will not be
a list of names and nothing more. But in
every century we shall find certain great
personalities, either on the throne or off it,
which should be made as vivid as may be.
To this rule the eleventh and twelfth are
no exception. There are five men in these
centuries which seem to me particularly
worth dwelling on: William I and Henry
II,&mdash;surely two of the really great kings of
England; Becket and Langton, types of
great churchmen and exemplars of the
enormous power of the Church; and Simon
de Montfort, highest type among the early
nobility. Vivid word pictures of the Conqueror
may be found in Freeman’s “Norman
Conquest,” Vol. II, pp. 106-113, and
(shorter) in Green’s “Short History,” pp.
74-76. Henry II is portrayed by a contemporary,
Cheyney’s “Readings,” pp. 137-139,
and in Green, pp. 104-105. Becket is described
by Green, p. 106, and a good story
of his relation to Henry II is told in Cheyney,
p. 144. For Langton see Green, pp.
126-127; for Simon de Montfort see Green,
152-153, or Cheyney, pp. 221-224.</p>


<h3>Further Notes and References.</h3>

<p>There is a good brief account of general
conditions&mdash;Church and State, development
of learning, town and country life, architecture,
etc., pp. 165-171 of Gardiner’s
“Student’s History.” If one can get the
time, a reading, or re-reading, as the case
may be, of Green’s “Short History” on the
towns, pp. 92-94; literature, pp. 117-121,
and the universities, pp. 132-141, is exceedingly
refreshing. Cheyney’s “Readings”
also contain interesting quotations on
the universities, pp. 188-195.</p>

<p>In bringing out the causes of the controversy
over the Constitutions of Clarendon,
it is appropriate to quote William the Conqueror’s
Edict (Cheyney, pp. 109-110) in
support of Becket’s contention, as well as
to read from the Constitutions themselves
(Cheyney, pp. 146-150). If one has time
for a little touch of humor and human nature
in the class-room, not strictly important
in itself, the account of the bishop’s
speeches before the pope, in connection with
the quarrel with Becket, is most amusing
(Cheyney, pp. 151-154).</p>

<p>For a very full and interesting account of
feudalism, see Beard’s “Introduction to
English Historians,” pp. 73-96. Shorter
quotations giving some interesting detail
have already been referred to (Cheyney,
pp. 131-136.)</p>

<p>A clear account of the Government of
England as established under the Normans
is contained in Chapter XVII of “The
Normans in Europe,” in the Epochs of History
series, pp. 234-248. “The Early Plantagenets”
in the same series, is concise and
useful for “side-lights” on John’s and
Henry III’s reigns.</p>

<p>On the Magna Charta, and on the Origin
of Parliament, Beard’s “Introduction,” pp.
110-123 and 124-138, respectively, contains a
mine of valuable comment. In connection
with the famous parliament of 1265 the
fact that parliament was not really a legislative
body at this time should be strongly
emphasized.</p>

<p>For realism, I know nothing better than
the graphic account in the “Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle” of the evils of Stephen’s reign
(Cheyney, pp. 128-130, or, more briefly,
Green, p. 103). The only good novel which
I know of in this period (I should be glad
to hear of others) is Maurice Hewlett’s
“Richard Yea and Nay,” a wonderfully
vivid book, but hardly suitable to put in
the hands of young folk in general.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_35"></a>Robinson and Beard’s Development of “Modern Europe”</h2>


<p class="authorindent">REVIEWED BY PROFESSOR SIDNEY B. FAY, OF DARTMOUTH COLLEGE.</p>

<p>If a teacher finds that the remoteness of
Pericles and Clovis makes it difficult to
arouse in the history class the most active
interest of the student, who nevertheless
would be keen to know something of Bismarck
and Li Hung Chang; or if a teacher
finds it unsatisfactory, in the second year
course in medieval and modern European
history to try to teach the spread of constitutional
government and democratic ideas
from the French to the Turkish Revolution
before the student knows anything of
the English parliamentary system and of
the Industrial Revolution; or if the teacher
is assailed by the school-board or by the
tax-paying parents of the pupils, on the
ground that ancient and medieval history
is relatively useless and ought to be replaced
by something more practical,&mdash;such
a teacher will find in these two volumes a
very present help in time of trouble.</p>

<p>The authors have thrown to the winds
the recommendations of the Committee of
Seven, and do not try to make their book
fit into any four years’ course as now outlined
for high schools. The first volume
begins with the reign of Louis XIV; and
from that moment the reader’s eye is constantly
directed forward to the present moment,
so that he can read intelligently the
dispatches from Europe in his morning
newspaper. Much of the traditional matter
is omitted in order to give fuller treatment
to those subjects which are most important
for an understanding of the present.
This leads to an arrangement and a
placing of emphasis which often seems
arbitrary and unhistorical,&mdash;as, for instance,
the scant half dozen pages given to
the whole reign of Napoleon III, or the insertion
in each volume of a score of pages
on natural science. It is, of course, desirable
to have the pupil have some knowledge
of the development and influence of such
fundamental subjects as evolution, bacteriology
and the atomic theory; but it is unwise
to put these things in a text-book of
history. Few teachers at present could
teach these pages properly; and efficiency
of instruction is likely to be weakened in
any institution where instructors trespass
on each others’ fields. This criticism, however,
does not apply to the remarkable
chapter on the Industrial Revolution and
to the excellent pages on socialism, colonial
expansion, Russo-Japanese relations and
other timely topics of present-day interest;
all of these may properly be taught by the
teacher of history.</p>

<p>The authors have made a text-book which
is accurate, lucid, packed with information,
and, at the same time, extremely readable.
It has already been used in some college
courses, and evokes real enthusiasm from
the students. They feel they are learning
things which are of practical value and are
up to date.</p>

<p>Probably this text-book, at present at any
rate, is better adapted for college than for
high school use. But schools of business
or commerce could very profitably use it.
Ordinary high schools should have it in the
school library for collateral reading, but
could not adopt it as a text-book until they
are ready to readjust their history curriculum
so as to give much more time than at
present to Modern European History. Perhaps
that time is not far distant.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_36"></a>American History in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorindent">ARTHUR M. WOLFSON, PH.D., Editor.</p>

<p class="center boldfont mediumfont">THE INFLUENCE OF OLIVER CROMWELL AND WILLIAM III ON AMERICAN HISTORY.</p>


<p>In teaching the history of Europe from
the Treaty of Westphalia to the beginning
of the French Revolution, no mistake is
commoner than the one of regarding the
almost continuous series of wars between
the European States as a purposeless
struggle for territorial aggrandizement.
Equally in American history, the teacher
is prone to allow his interest in the growth
of social and political institutions to obscure
the fact that the North American
continent was, for nearly a century, merely
a distant battleground on which Holland,
England and France were struggling for commercial
supremacy. “Unity is given to the
history of England in the eighteenth century,”
says Seeley (“Expansion of England,”
p. 77), “if you remark the single fact that
Greater Britain during that period was
establishing itself in opposition to Greater
France.... You will, I think, find it
very helpful in studying the history of
those two countries always to bear in mind
that throughout most of that period the
five States of Western Europe all alike are
not properly European States but world
States, and that they debate continually
among themselves a mighty question, which
is not European at all and which the student
with his eye fixed on Europe is too apt to
disregard, namely, the question of the possession
of the New World.” In the same
way, the student of American history must
be continually reminded that he is studying
not the history of half a dozen or more
isolated communities, but a phase of a
great European struggle for world power.</p>


<h3>Struggle with the Dutch.</h3>

<p>From 1689 to 1763, this struggle is
marked by an almost continuous war between
France and England. An earlier generation,
however, witnessed a similar struggle
between Holland and England. This
earlier struggle is also vitally important
in the history of North America.
Few students of American history are
aware of the unprecedented growth of
the Dutch maritime power during the first
half of the seventeenth century. To most
of them the founding of New Netherlands
is an isolated fact, comparatively unimportant
because the Dutch colony ultimately
fell into the hands of the English. The
fact nevertheless remains that throughout
the greater part of the seventeenth century
the carrying trade of the world was in the
hands of the Dutch and Amsterdam was the
exchange of the world. What Venice had
been in the fifteenth century, Amsterdam
became in the seventeenth.</p>

<p>“To break this monopoly was England’s
object; and to raise his country to a position
of leadership in the commercial world
was one of the greatest ambitions of Cromwell.”
(Andrew’s “Colonial Self Government,”
p. 11; see also p. 15). In 1651, at
the instance of Cromwell, Parliament passed
the first Navigation Act, “for the increase
of the shipping and the encouragement of
the navigation of this [the English] nation.”
In the light of later events, we in America
are too apt to regard this act and its successors
as designed to limit the trade of the
colonies. As a matter of fact, a sufficient
study of these acts, especially those of
1651 and 1660, will show that they were
aimed directly at the Dutch who were at
the time the maritime carriers both for
England and for the other nations of
Europe.</p>


<h3>The Navigation Acts.</h3>

<p>As a result of the first Navigation Act,
England entered almost at once on the
series of three wars, 1652-1654, 1665-1667,
1672-1674, which lasted just long enough
to break the commercial supremacy of Holland.
Every school boy knows that as a
result of these wars England acquired the
colony of New Netherlands, but few, even
of his elders, realize that, “The Navigation
Act, which remained substantially in force
for nearly two hundred years is the great
legislative monument of the Commonwealth,
it was the first manifestation of the newly
awakened consciousness of the community,
the act which laid the foundation of
the English commercial empire.” (Seeley’s
“Growth of British Policy,” II, p. 25.)</p>

<p>Throughout this period of rivalry between
Holland and England, especially after 1660,
often against the will of the people, the
English government maintained a close alliance
with the king of France, the bitterest
enemy of the Dutch people. In the last
years of the reign of James II, however, the
tide of English feeling turned irresistibly
against the French alliance. Though James
still looked to his cousin, Louis XIV, for
aid and comfort, the people of England
would have no more of him, and for this
reason, as well as for purely domestic reasons,
James was in the end forced to flee
from the country. Thenceforward, there
was a complete change in the English foreign
policy.</p>


<h3>The Dutch and English Against France.</h3>

<p>When William of Orange, Stadtholder of
Holland, the most uncompromising enemy
of Louis XIV, accepted the crown of England
there came not only a complete revolution
in the English constitutional system,
but also, and far more important for the
history of the American colonies, a complete
revolution in England’s foreign policy. War
between England and France, in spite of the
traditional rivalry handed down from Plantagenet
times, had been extremely rare;
Englishmen and Frenchmen had lived peacefully
side by side for half a century or more
in the northeastern part of North America,
while Englishmen and Dutchmen were
struggling for the possession of the territory
between Long Island Sound and Delaware
Bay. Henceforth, the English and the
Dutch were to fight side by side in the
effort to break the power of Louis the Magnificent
both in Europe and in America.
Just as between 1651 and 1689 it was the
first interest of the English that the maritime
power of the Dutch should be broken,
so now, “it was a first interest of England
that the encroachments of France should be
arrested, and that the Dutch should be
saved from destruction. The rivalry between
the English and Dutch must cease;
the two sea powers must combine in opposition
to France” (Seeley, “Growth of
British Policy,” II, p. 207).</p>

<p>How efficiently William III set this policy
in motion is attested by the history of
Europe and America in the eighteenth century.
Though he personally never realized
the magnitude of the issue, though from
first to last he was primarily interested in
the preservation of Holland, though had he
realized that his work was to result in the
aggrandizement of England at the expense
both of Holland and France, he would probably
never have accepted the English
throne, the far-reaching effects of this policy
are to be seen not only in America but
in Asia and in Africa as well. The accession
of William III is thus the turning point
in American colonial history. Almost at
once, he set in motion that series of wars
which ended in America only when the last
vestige of French colonial empire had disappeared
from the continent. What he began,
Marlborough and Pitt, in later generations,
completed.</p>


<h3>Influence Upon America.</h3>

<p>If we keep these facts in mind: first, that
the Navigation Act of 1651 inaugurated a
trade policy that was to build up the English
carrying trade at the expense of the
Dutch; and second, that the accession of
William of Orange as William III of England
marked the end of the rivalry between
the English and the Dutch and inaugurated
the struggle between the English and the
French, Oliver Cromwell and William of
Orange become two of the most important
figures in American history and therefore
deserve far more attention than is usually
accorded them in teaching American history.</p>

<p>For the further study of this phase of
American history, the student is recommended
to the works of Fiske and Parkman,
and to the shorter treatises contained in the
volumes of Hart’s “American Nation.”
Especially important, however, are the two
works of Professor J. R. Seeley which have
several times been quoted in this paper:
“The Growth of British Policy” and the
“Expansion of England.”</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_37"></a>A New Text-Book on American History By James and Sanford</h2>


<p class="authorindent">REVIEWED BY JOHN SHARPLESS FOX, PH.D., OF THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL, CHICAGO.</p>

<p>The new text-book by James and Sanford
is an advanced and compendious manual
for use in high schools. In it the
authors have escaped in large measure the
fault common to some of our older texts
of writing an <em>essay</em> on American history;
on the other hand they have avoided the
more grievous error of dumping a mass of
undigested facts into their book. They
have borne in mind the important principle
that generalizations, to be useful, must be
accompanied by the <em>facts</em>. The <em>how</em> and the
<em>why</em> are explained in this text, and the
authors do not assume an undue intimacy
with providence.</p>

<p>It has been their aim, they tell us, “to
give the main features in the development
of our nation, to explain the America of
to-day, its civilization and its traditions.”
They have sought to emphasize “the
achievements of men and women” in the
more important fields of human activity,&mdash;the
“political, industrial, educational and
religious.” “Military phases of our history
... have been subordinated to the
accounts of the victories of peace.” They
have given unusual attention to “the advance
of the frontier” and to “the growth
and influence of the West”; and “particular
care has been taken to state the essential
facts in European history necessary to
the explanation of events in America.” Unlike
some of our older books,&mdash;and the parson
who announces his text and bids it
adieu&mdash;the authors have given no separate
chapter or section to physical geography,
but have called attention to the influence of
geographical conditions in connection with
events and conditions as they arise. In
the opinion of the reviewer, this method
has received a large measure of justification
in the event, (e. g., pp. 92-95.)</p>

<p>In the matter of proportion, the authors
have assigned much more space than is
usual to the period following the Civil War,
and considerably less to the period from
1789 to 1860; yet the latter does not suffer
thereby. The book is divided into chapters
(XXXI), with appropriate titles, and marginal
notes indicate the contents of paragraphs.
Information of a more advanced
and supplementary character has been
placed in smaller type, which may be
omitted by teachers lacking time, or at discretion.
It is not clear, however, why the
Ordinance of 1787 should be relegated to
this minor position (p. 189).</p>


<h3>Colonial History.</h3>

<p>The account of the thirteen colonies is
of sufficient fulness to show clearly the
origins of the people and their institutions.
It is, however, a matter of regret that the
authors have not made it clearer that the
thirteen mainland colonies who won their
independence were not the only English
colonial establishments in America. The
discovery of America is made reasonable
(pp. 1-10); the varying motives of English
and European colonization, and the principal
difficulties in the way of permanent settlement
by Europeans in America are
clearly set forth (pp. 30-40, 91); the fact
that the Puritans were political as well as
religious refugees, of a practical character,
and not merely religious idealists, is made
clear (pp. 53-55). The land systems prevailing
in the different colonies are explained
(pp. 43, 47, 52, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et passim</i>), and the
more general statement is made (p. 91):
“The great underlying economic fact of this
[eighteenth century] colonization was the
existence in America of boundless areas of
cultivable land that might be had on easy
terms.” The Indians are treated in their
contact with the whites, and their degeneracy
is made the occasion of general remarks
on the inevitable consequences attending
the contact between a superior and
an inferior race (pp. 98-100). Here, too,
“the land question” is shown to be fundamental.
The influence of the fur-trade in
this and later times is dwelt upon (pp. 97-98,
108, 111). A notable statement of seventeenth
century colonial conditions and of
eighteenth century problems occurs on
pages 101-102.</p>

<p>Social and economic life receives unusual
attention throughout the book, and wherever
possible is shown in its relation to
physical conditions and environment. The
West receives the best treatment we have
noted in any text-book. Excellent accounts
of why the settlers went to the West, how
they travelled, how they obtained their
land, and of how Western democracy arose
and reacted on the East, are here given.
(See “Westward Migration and Internal
Improvements,” pp. 273-281).</p>

<p>The authors make no attempt to “write
down” to their readers, and we suspect
that some of their economic discussions of
international trade, financial crises, and
monetary problems will overshoot the
mark. Be it said, however, that things are
everywhere reduced to their simplest terms.
Something must be left to the teacher,&mdash;and
to providence! Some of the other
more important topics treated are: Progress
in invention and labor-saving devices,
and their attendant effects on production;
the growth of commerce due to
increased facilities for transportation; the
growth of capitalistic combinations, corporations,
and trusts, with their attendant
problems of legislative regulation; the rise
of labor unions and their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’etre</i>
(Chapters XXVII, XXIX). Educational,
literary, philanthropic, and religious history
are given due attention.</p>


<h3>Topics and Biographical Notes.</h3>

<p>An excellent feature of the political and
constitutional history is the presence of
brief biographical sketches of important
statesmen. For teachers who prefer to
teach American government in connection
with the history, special provision is made
by means of marginal references and supplementary
questions, and an elaborate outline
of topics arising in the text is added
(Appendix I, pp. 527-534), with appropriate
references to the Constitution and to the
authors’ “Government in State and Nation.”
This is further supplemented by a
list of topics, relating to other features of
our government not naturally arising in a
history course.</p>

<p>The book is provided with abundant and
well-selected illustrations, from authentic
sources; the maps are numerous and helpful,
but not distinctive. At the end of each
chapter are suggestive and stimulating
topics and questions, with references within
the compass of high school pupils. These
references are almost unique in that they
are <em>specific</em> and <em>brief</em>.</p>

<p>A few inaccuracies and misleading statements
have been noticed: The statement,
“There was no gold in this region” (p.
23), referring to Spanish territory in the
United States, should be modified. None
was <em>found</em>. For “Eyler” read Tyler (p.
67); for “Cheney” (p. 91), read Cheyney.
The remark respecting the slave trade,
that “during colonial times no protest
seems to have arisen against the wickedness
and inhumanity of this traffic” (p.
131) loses sight of the Mennonite protest
of 1688, as well as the work and writings
of John Woolman, Anthony Benezet, and
others. Finally, Connecticut is correctly
stated Democratic in the text, but erroneously
Republican in the Election Map of
1876 (p. 447).</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the book is well
adapted to its purpose. The style is usually
simple and direct; facts are well
selected and are clearly and impartially
stated; the scholarship is of a high order.
The index might be made fuller with profit.</p>

<h3>Scope of the Month’s Work.</h3>

<p>In our larger city schools the work is so
systematized that the teacher knows just
how far along he should be at any season
of the year. For teachers who are working
by themselves in small schools and are not
specialists in history a very useful guide
may be found in the “History Syllabus
for Secondary Schools,” issued by the New
England History Teachers’ Association, and
published by D. C. Heath &amp; Co., of Boston.
The “Outline of Ancient History,” in
pamphlet form may be had by itself. One
value of these outlines is that they divide
the work into one hundred exercises, and
then indicate the proportion of time this
group of teachers have found it wise to
devote to each section of the work. During
October the teacher ought to carry his
class down nearly to the Persian invasions,
and at least as far as the development of
Sparta.</p>


<h3>Importance of the Greeks.</h3>

<p>It is hard for the cultured teacher to feel
the difference between his own attitude
toward Greece and that of the child of fourteen
or fifteen who is approaching the subject
for the first time. To such a child
Greece is simply a name as yet. And it
would seem to be a good practice for the
teacher in a simple talk to try to enlist the
interest of his class by some statement of
the reasons why we are going to devote
nearly a half year to the study of a very
little, and to-day very obscure, country.
The teacher should show certain characteristics
which make Greece of vast importance.
Among these will be found the fact
of the wonderful intellectual force of the
Greeks, which led them into the same lines
of thought and investigation which interest
the modern world; their love of independence,
in such marked contrast with the
servility of the Oriental races at whose
history we have been looking in the past
month, and especially their artistic supremacy,
which made them the great masters in
the creation of beauty for all time; and
their masterpieces in architecture and
sculpture should be contrasted with the
work of Egyptians and Mesopotamians, for
the most part so grotesque and unlovely.</p>

<p>This article will not attempt to follow
the month’s lessons at all in detail, but
will emphasize the main things which the
young student should carry forward with
him as the early story of this people who
made themselves in so many ways the forerunners
of our modern life.</p>


<h3>Map Work.</h3>

<p>An early task is to become familiar with
the physical characteristics of the land.
Nothing will help better than map-drawing.
Relief maps are of great service as showing
the mountainous nature and the effect of
this on private and public life. Ancient
Greece was about two hundred and fifty
miles in length from north to south and
one hundred and sixty-five miles at the
most from east to west. It lies between
the thirty-sixth and fortieth parallels of
latitude, corresponding very closely in distance
and latitude to our coast as it extends
from the partition line of the Carolinas
up as far as New York City. A comparison
of the area of Greece with that of
the pupil’s own State is desirable. For
instance, while the area of New York State
is about 48,000 square miles, Greece contained
but 21,000. And very early in the
course the fact should be brought out that
this tiny territory, in the greatest days of
its people, was never united politically, but
divided into rival States, really nations,
each only about as large as one of our
counties. A wholesome corrective to our
American boastfulness over size may be
found in the slightness of area and population
of this marvellous land, which has contributed
so many more than its proportionate
share of mighty men.</p>


<h3>Races and Migrations.</h3>

<p>Pelasgian, Mycenean, Achæan, Dorian,&mdash;such
was the order of the peoples who made
Greece. The Greeks, or Hellenes, in whom
our interest is centered, belong to the two
last of these groups. The Pelasgians concern
us in the high schools only as much
as the men of the stone age in British history.
The Myceneans we know only from
the ruins of their towns. That in some
respects they were ahead of the earlier
Achæans might be pointed out. The relationship
of the historic Greeks to the other
races of Europe and their kindred with ourselves
are important. We feel strange
toward Egyptian and Babylonian, but are
cousins to the Greeks. The teacher who
happens to know Greek might show the
similarities of Greek and English speech
in the common homely words of everyday
life.</p>


<h3>Epic, Myth and Legend.</h3>

<p>Most of our pupils have heard in the
lower schools something of Homer and his
“Iliad” and “Odyssey”; and the stories
of some of the gods and heroes are more or
less familiar. When the teacher comes to
the Homeric poems he will not be able to
interest his young charges very much in
their higher criticism; but he would do
well, if time allow, to use the special topic
and report method here. The story of the
“Iliad,” the theme of the “Odyssey,” and
certain characteristic episodes from each
might be read to the class by pupils
assigned to such duty. A similar course
may be taken with regard to the legends
of the heroes and gods. One interesting
story read will be worth a week of mere
recital of the twelve labors of Heracles,
or the dry account of the fact that Perseus
had something to do with Medusa, and
Bellerophon with the Chimæra.</p>

<p>In these times of slighting of the ancient
world it is well to reflect how many of the
commonest allusions of literature, and even
of political editorials, depend for their
meaning upon some knowledge of the Greek
stories. We speak of “hundred-handed”
(Briareus) or “hundred-headed” (Hydra)
evils of municipal mismanagement; we talk
of “cleansing the Augean stables”; Cyclops,
Siren, Gorgon, Chimæra, are household
words. We owe it to the children not
to let them escape into life without some
ability to grasp the content of such daily
allusions.</p>


<h3>Early Politics.</h3>

<p>Mention has already been made of the
petty size of the typical Greek State. The
marvel is that the Greeks did so much while
so divided. We shall speak of “city
states.” Some child will run away with a
notion of something like New York or Boston
with its suburbs. Make them feel
that all Greece never had as many people
as New York City.</p>

<p>It was the intense Greek individualism
which kept the States apart. The difference
between Greek individualism and that
of the Englishman or American should be
indicated. The latter is personal. The
Greek was swallowed up in his State, that
was his unit and his love.</p>

<p>The progress through monarchy, oligarchy
and tyranny to democracy is rightly
made much of in the books. (Compare the
“tyrant” with our “boss.”) When we
come to the development and the glories of
the Greek democracy a large degree of caution
is needed. In the writer’s opinion
there is a good deal of glamour about this
so-called democracy. The best Greek
never dreamed of manhood suffrage, or the
rights of man as man. In his view never
were “all men created free and equal.”
Athens in her best days had but 30,000
voters, and refused citizenship to all outsiders,
even fellow-Greeks from across the
nearest border line. Slavery was one of
the corner-stones of society. So far as it
went, the democracy of Athens was of the
pure type. That should be made plain
when reached. While our modern democracy,
save for minor phases, is representative
and not pure, the fact remains that the
nineteenth century has brought to birth
the only real democracy. And that is one
point of our superiority over the Greeks
and of more importance than our mechanical
and scientific advantages.</p>

<p>West, in his “Ancient World,” gives an
excellent summary of the bonds which
made the Greek world one against all “barbarians”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in spite of rivalries among their
petty States. He cites (pp. 95-97) the
common language and literature; the belief
in racial kinship; the Olympian religion,
with its games, oracles and amphictyonies,
as such forceful bonds of union.</p>

<p>The little land we know as Greece was
but a small part of the Hellenic world.
Doubtless the eastern shore of the Ægean
Sea was as truly Hellenic as Attica or
Sparta. And the colonies from that coast
to Massilia in the west, and notably in
Sicily and Magna Græcia, were of vast importance
in spreading Greek speech and
ideals through the later Roman world and
down into modern times. The political independence
of the Greek colony is of interest.
A good exercise for some student
would be to point out how Marseilles, or
Syracuse or Chalcis or Cumæ differed in
their relations to the parent States from
the relationship of the Philippines to the
United States, or of Canada or India to
Great Britain. And this topic is another
illustration of the truth that save for a
few cases like the successful resistance to
the Persians, the service of the Greeks to
the world has been mainly in the intellectual
rather than in the physical and political
sphere.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_39"></a>Social Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero</h2>


<p class="authorindent">FOWLER’S RECENT WORK REVIEWED BY PROFESSOR A. C. HOWLAND.</p>

<p>This book on Roman social life in the last
generation of the Republic, by the well-known
author of “The City State of the
Greeks and Romans” and other studies in
ancient history, will be welcomed by teachers
both of Roman history and of Latin.
No other study in English deals with just
this aspect of the period, and the easy style
and interesting method of presentation
make the work especially valuable as collateral
reading for classes. Its material
has been drawn largely from Cicero’s correspondence
and the results of widely-scattered
investigations have here been brought
together and digested.</p>

<p>The first chapter is devoted to the
topography of Rome. After a statement of
the principal geographical causes for the
growth of Roman dominion (pp. 4-8), there
follows (pp. 12-23) a description of the
main points of interest within the walls in
Cicero’s day, the account being noteworthy
alike for its clearness and for its omission
of details. A good map at the end of the
book enables the reader to fix each feature
of the city accurately. The second chapter,
on the lower population, is perhaps the
most interesting in the book, as it deals
with a topic seldom discussed and on which
our information is very meager. The subject
is discussed under three heads&mdash;how
this population was housed, how it was fed
and clothed and how it was employed. Notwithstanding
the contempt felt by the
writers of the period for the lower classes,
Mr. Fowler makes it evident that an understanding
of their environment will explain
many an obscure point in the history of the
period. Why, for instance, had the old
Roman religion fallen into such decay at
the close of the Republic? We naturally
look for scepticism among the cultured,
where the old traditions had been undermined
by the sudden influx of wealth and
Greek culture, but not among the poor and
ignorant, who could have been little
touched by such influences. But when we
consider the tenement houses in which the
poor lived, with whole families occupying
but one or two rooms (pp. 28-32), it can
be seen that there was no place here for the
Penates or the family hearth, that the old
domestic rites, which constituted the
Roman religion so far as it affected the individual,
were of necessity driven out and
that the poorer classes were forced to satisfy
their religious cravings by substituting
the gregarious, non-family oriental cults,
with their common temples and services.
Here the worshippers could enter into personal
relations with a deity as they could
not in the indigenous Roman temple, which
had to do solely with the State’s worship.
The only other point around which the personal
religious feeling of the old Roman
clung&mdash;the family tomb&mdash;likewise no longer
existed for the poor Roman of the city,
who could not afford this luxury, but must
see the members of his family cast into a
common burying place with many others
(p. 320).</p>

<p>As to the employment of the lower
classes, it is pointed out that in spite of
the contempt for retail trade and the
crafts&mdash;a feeling similar to that of the
higher classes in England and due to the
same causes&mdash;there were many callings at
which free Romans must have worked at
this time, including milling and baking,
market gardening, shoemaking, the making
and washing of woolen clothing, etc. (pp.
42-55). But the inadequacy of legal protection
for the poor and the uncertainty of
employment made a regular income precarious.</p>

<p>In chapter III there is given an excellent
description of the activities and business
organizations of the Equites in their capacities
both as public contractors (pp.
65-80) and as private business men (pp.
80-94), which throws much light on the
sources of wealth and the financial methods
of this class. The following chapter, on
the governing aristocracy, attempts to
classify the various types of the nobility
and to illustrate each by a brief sketch of
some one of its members. The attitude of
the old and new nobility towards each
other, the effects for good and for evil of
the Greek culture on the various classes,
and the frivolity and absence of the sense
of responsibility among the younger public
men are well brought out. The lively description
of Cœlius, the talented, but scatter-brained,
young friend and pupil of
Cicero (pp. 127-33), is one of the most
interesting passages of the book.</p>

<p>After thus taking up the different classes
of the Roman population, the author proceeds
to discuss the more general aspects
of the life of the day under such headings
as “Marriage and the Roman Lady,” “Education
of the Upper Classes,” “The Slave
Population,” “The House of the Rich Man
in Town and Country,” “Daily Life of the
Well-to-do,” “Holidays and Public Amusements
and Religion.” The treatment
throughout is fresh and vivid, except in the
chapter on public amusements, which is
rather uninteresting. Under the subject of
marriage, after a discussion of the decay
of that institution and the increase of
divorce and immorality, we are especially
grateful for the story of the long and beautiful
wedded life, as found in the so-called
“Laudatio Turiæ,” and now told in full in
English for the first time (pp. 158-67).
There must have been many similar cases
of domestic devotion and happiness, but
they naturally pass unmentioned in the
writings of the time, as they largely do in
the literature of our own day. The discussion
of Roman education is valuable because
it explains the weak points of the
system and the way in which these produced
many of the moral shortcomings in
the men of the day. The question of slavery
is viewed from an unprejudiced standpoint.
Its influence on the depopulation of
the provinces is clearly brought out (pp.
206-10), but it is also shown that its
economic effects in Italy were not altogether
evil, and that slave labor by no
means drove free labor from the market
(pp. 213-22). The author holds with
Wallon<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Seeck<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that the unrestricted
manumission of slaves had on the whole an
injurious effect on Roman life and character.
The Roman idea of religion, so puzzling
to the average student, is nowhere
more clearly explained than in the last
chapter, and here as elsewhere the treatment
is so simple and plain as well as
scholarly, that no better book can be placed
in the hands of a class.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_40"></a>History in the Grades</h2>


<p class="authorindent">ARMAND J. GERSON, Editor.</p>

<p class="center boldfont mediumfont">COLUMBUS,&mdash;SPANISH EXPLORER.<br />
A TYPE-LESSON.</p>

<p>If the lesson on Columbus is to be indeed
a type-lesson, it behooves the teacher in
preparing it to make a careful selection of
such elements of the story as may properly
form the basis for the subsequent teaching
of other Spanish explorers. As was pointed
out in this department in last month’s
issue,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the truest economy in history teaching
consists in the careful construction of a
definite foundation of correct historical concepts
upon which the detailed superstructure
of later lessons may be rapidly and
yet substantially reared.</p>

<p>Certain elements in the life, environment,
and explorations of Christopher Columbus
may well be used as the foundation for the
teaching of all the Spanish explorations of
the New World. These essential elements
should be presented with great thoroughness,
and the children’s interest in them
made active and enthusiastic. Their knowledge
of them must be concrete, many-sided,
living; only then will it constitute what
the psychologist likes to call the “apperceptive
basis” for subsequent analysis,
comparison, and generalization.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the teaching of
Columbus will necessarily involve many
facts which belong distinctively to his life
and actions, and to which later Spanish
explorations have little, or at the most a
very remote relation. It is obvious that the
teaching of such portions of our topic can
hardly be said to constitute a “type-lesson.”
These points serve a definite purpose
of their own, and should be presented in
their own way. Let us, therefore, in our
practical consideration of the presentation
of our lesson on Columbus, consider separately
the “type-elements” and what for
convenience we may call the “specific elements.”</p>


<h3>Previous Preparation.</h3>

<p>In the first place, in the preparation of
our lesson on Columbus, as, in fact, in the
preparation of any lesson, the teacher must
have definitely in mind just what preliminary
instruction has been given. Let us
assume, then, that the soil has been prepared,&mdash;that
the class is already familiar
with the ideas of the size and shape of the
earth which were current in the 15th century;
with the parts of the world that were
known; with the general geographical situation
of the chief nations of Europe; with
the nature of the trade with the Far East;
and, still more important, with the causes
of the activity of the time in the direction
of finding new trade routes to the
Orient. These basic ideas should have become
firmly fixed and their interrelations
clearly brought out before we introduce our
Columbus “type-lesson.”</p>

<p>What are the essential features of the
Columbus lesson, the emphasis of which
will entitle it to be considered a “type-lesson”?
Or, to re-phrase our query, what
are the “type-elements” of the story of
Columbus?</p>


<h3>Spanish Characteristics.</h3>

<p>First of all, if our lesson is to typify
the Spanish explorers as a group, it should
supply a basic concept of Spanish life and
character in the 15th and 16th centuries.
It is not a matter of much difficulty to
arouse in our pupils a real interest in the
Spaniards of that time. There is so much
of the romantic and the picturesque about
this phase of American history that for
the conscientious teacher it will always
constitute one of the most attractive portions
of his work. Varied selections from
literature suitable to the age of the children
should be read to them. Better still,
they should be encouraged to continue this
sort of reading on their own accounts; appropriate
material for this purpose should
be on hand in the school library. The religious
element in Spanish life should receive
particular emphasis, some reference being
made to the Inquisition and the popular
attitude toward heresy. As an important
element in the European background of
American history, this phase of our subject
dare not be overlooked, but it goes
without saying that in our public schools
it is a topic which must be handled with
extreme tact. The severe etiquette of the
Spanish court, the Spanish dress, Spanish
arms and armor, should all receive their
proper amount of attention. Pictures, as
well as stories, should be brought into constant
requisition to make this portion of
the work concrete.</p>

<p>Some notion of the political standing and
relations of Spain, properly adapted to children
of elementary school age, must also
be considered as essentially a “type-element”
in our lesson. For pupils in the
grades it will probably suffice to point out
very briefly the long struggle with the
Moors, brought to a successful termination
by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492; the
combination in the 16th century of various
and widely separate realms under the
Hapsburgs; and the natural jealousy of
France and England toward this rising
world-power.</p>

<p>The next “type-element” necessary to
consider will be the topic of Spanish modes
of navigation. At this point our lesson becomes
typical of the period of exploration
in general rather than of Spanish explorations
in particular, inasmuch as Spanish
vessels, sailors, etc., were not, for our purposes
in the grades at least, essentially different
from those of other contemporary
nations. It is important, however, that our
pupils should have definite ideas on this
point if their knowledge of the early explorations
is to be in any true sense real.
Pictures of Spanish vessels of the period
are easy to procure, and should be referred
to in this connection. Attention should be
called to the significant features of these
boats,&mdash;their small size, their peculiar construction,
their usual rate of speed, etc.
In all purely descriptive work of this sort
it is well for the teacher to keep in mind
that a happy comparison is frequently of
more value than pages of prosy details and
measurements. Take, for example, Mark
Twain’s delightful comparison in his description
of one of the pyramids: each
stone as big as a freight-car!</p>

<p>Finally, the prevailing superstitious fears
of unknown seas, wild notions regarding
the monsters of the deep and inhabitants
of distant lands, the consequent scarcity of
sailors for voyages of exploration, the bravery
and steadfastness of purpose required
to lead such an expedition,&mdash;these points
may surely be said to constitute a “type-element.”
To be sure, as time went on
and ignorance of distant regions gradually
disappeared, the force of these factors in
history diminished. Throughout the exploration
period, however, they remain an
element to be reckoned with and constantly
to be referred to. Selections from Mandeville
might very appropriately be read in
this connection to lend color and life to the
presentation.</p>


<h3>Life of Columbus.</h3>

<p>We are now ready to consider what we
have designated the “specific elements” of
the Columbus lesson; that is, those features
of the story that refer to Columbus as an
individual explorer, but can hardly be considered
typical of the Spanish explorations
in general. If the “type-elements” have
been duly impressed, this portion of the
lesson will present little difficulty and can
be covered in a comparatively short time,
largely, in fact, in the form of readings.</p>

<p>The nationality and early life of Columbus
should first occupy the attention of
teacher and class. The fact that he was an
Italian is significant. Passing reference
might well be made to the political disorganization
of Italy and the declining importance
of its commercial centers. The
boyhood of our hero is picturesque and may
easily be made to arouse the interest of
boys and girls of our own day. Let them
feel that he was a child like themselves
and give them some appreciation of his
childhood’s environment,&mdash;the Italian sky
and sea-coast.</p>

<p>The geographical ideas of Columbus and
the development of his pet project have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
definite relation to the preliminary lessons
on the geographical notions of his time.
His errors should be clearly pointed out.
In this portion of the presentation, as in
most others, a good wall map must be on
hand for constant reference.</p>

<p>The futile attempts of Columbus to get
the support necessary for his venture need
not occupy us long. His experience at the
court of Spain, however, and his first voyage
will require more elaborate treatment.
Here constant reference must be made to
the “type-elements,”&mdash;particularly in connection
with Spanish court life, Spanish
motives, the furnishing and manning of the
three boats which constituted his fleet.</p>

<p>The subsequent voyages of Columbus
may be passed over very rapidly, preferably
with very little detail. Similarly his later
life and his sad death will call for but passing
notice.</p>

<p>This entire narrative portion of our topic
is largely handled for us by any of the
standard elementary text-books, which, by
the way, it is important that our pupils
should learn to use. The real teaching, that
is to say, the history tracing and idea-building,
has been accomplished in connection
with the “type-elements.” The rest
of the problem in large measure solves
itself.</p>

<p>The “type-lesson” on Columbus just outlined
will occupy a number of history
periods. It is important that it should not
be hurried. The old pedagogic maxim that
we should make haste slowly applies with
peculiar force to the “type-lesson” method.
We begin slowly that we may gain time
later. More than that, we are furnishing
our pupils with a definite stock of fundamental
historical notions which will constitute
for them a genuine intellectual capital.
As they go on with the study of history,
they will find that their “type ideas”
help to interpret the detailed facts they
meet, which facts in turn will tend to re-enforce
the “type-ideas.”</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_41"></a>Reports from the Historical Field</h2>


<p class="authorindent">WALTER H. CUSHING, Editor.</p>


<h3>A New Organization.</h3>

<p>The history teachers of Colorado are
about to organize an association and have
appointed a committee, of which Professor
James G. Willard is chairman. With so
many questions in history teaching still
unsettled, we welcome a new organization
which by discussion and interchange of
views will hasten the solution of these
problems. The history teachers in about
one-half the States of the Union are now
included in organizations, with the American
Historical Association as a sort of
clearing house.</p>


<h3>Raising the Standard in Louisiana.</h3>

<p>Heretofore the State course of study has
not provided for a satisfactory history program
in the high schools, but with this
year a new course of study goes into operation
which gives about three years to history.
At the request of the State Department
of Education Professor Walter L.
Fleming, of the State University, has prepared
a syllabus covering the work, with
suggestions for map work, reading, note-books,
etc. In the future two or even three
years’ work in history may be required of
the candidates for the freshman class.</p>

<p>Considerable interest has been developed
in certain fields of history by the Rally Day
competition at the University. The high
schools of the State send representatives to
the High School Rally Day at the University
in April. These pupils are chosen after
local contests and sent to Baton Rouge.
The pupils’ subjects for the debate and
essay contests are published by the Program
Committee.</p>

<p>To prepare teachers adequately for their
work two courses are offered at the State
University, one in “Methods of Teaching
History,” and another in “Aids in the
Studying and Teaching of History.” Instruction
covers use of texts, sources, reference
works, map work, pictures, advertising,
material useful in history teaching,
etc. Great improvement is already noticeable
and especially good work is done in
Shreveport and New Orleans.</p>


<h3>Proceedings of the North Central History Teachers’ Association.</h3>

<p>The annual report of this association,
containing the papers and discussions of the
April meeting, was issued during the summer.
As usual, it contains much which will
repay careful reading and reflection even
by those who were fortunate enough to be
present at the meeting. Professor Samuel
B. Harding, of Indiana University, in treating
of “Some Concrete Problems in the
Teaching of Medieval and Modern History,”
opposed the plan of teaching this
field of history on the “single nation” plan.
With regard to the proportion of time to
be allotted the parts of this course, he
advocated giving roughly one-third to the
period 800 A.D.-1500 A.D.; another one-third
to the period ending with 1789, and
the final one-third to the French Revolution
and the 19th century. He suggested several
devices for emphasizing the “time” problem,
or chronology, urged the use of maps,
and especially called attention to the greatest
problem, how to make history concrete,
how to make it definite. The speaker advocated
the regular use of note-books and
urged a greater use of pictures.</p>

<p>In considering “What Changes Should be
Made in the Report of the Committee of
Seven?” Professor A. C. McLaughlin referred
to the complaint, especially in the
East, against the great length of the course
in ancient history. He gave reasons why it
had seemed desirable to the Committee of
Seven to continue the study of Roman history
to 800 A.D., and predicted that the
Committee of Five will cling to that year,
“but recommend, more decidedly and with
more assurance than did the earlier report,
the somewhat hasty perusal of the period
from 300 to 800. It may be desirable to
state very distinctly and definitely what
topics should be taken up....</p>

<p>“The most perplexing question is how
the general history of Western Europe
should be treated from 800 or thereabouts
to the present time.” The speaker would
not change the general arrangement of the
four blocks recommended in the old report,
but advised a very hurried treatment of the
first six or eight hundred years. (Compare
Professor Harding, above.) There are serious
objections to giving up a continuous
and unbroken treatment of English history
as is sometimes recommended.</p>

<p>In its recommendation on Civil Government
the Committee of Seven seems to
have been misunderstood. The old report
did not advise that separate courses in civil
government should not be given. It urged
a strong combined course in American history
and government in preference to two
separate weak courses. In any case they
should be taught as interrelated and interdependent
subjects.</p>

<p>At the business meeting of the association,
Carl E. Pray, of the Normal School,
Milwaukee, was elected president, and
George H. Gaston, of the Wendell Phillips
High School, Chicago, was re-elected secretary.</p>


<h3>A Syllabus in Civil Government for Secondary Schools.</h3>

<p>Considerable interest has been aroused
in the forthcoming syllabus in Civil Government
prepared by a special committee of
the New England History Teachers’ Association,
for whom it will be published late
in the fall by the Macmillan Company.</p>

<p>There will be two parts to the book: An
introduction of about twenty pages given
to a discussion of the general subject and
representing in a limited field the relation
that the report of the Committee of Seven
bore to the History Syllabus; and the syllabus
proper consisting of approximately
one hundred and twenty pages, with topics,
diagrams, general and specific references
and bibliographies. Specimen pages of the
syllabus have been tried in the class-rooms
of schools in widely different parts of the
country, and the subject was discussed at
the April meeting of the association.</p>

<p>Many problems confronted the committee
at the outset, and at least a working agreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had to be reached upon the following
questions:</p>

<p class="numberitem1">1. What should be the position of the
study and what time allotment should it
reasonably expect?</p>

<p class="numberitem1">2. What should be the aims of instruction
in government in secondary schools?</p>

<p class="numberitem1">3. What should be the scope and what
should be the places of emphasis?</p>

<p class="numberitem1">4. What should be its relation to other
subjects of the curriculum?</p>

<p class="numberitem1">5. What should be the point of attack
and order of topics?</p>

<p class="numberitem1">6. What should be the method?</p>

<p class="numberitem1">7. What should be the form of the syllabus?</p>

<p>The conclusions reached by the committee
may be briefly summarized. Two or two
and one-half forty-five-minute periods a
week should be allotted, and the subject
should be correlated with United States
history. Instruction in civics should aim
to train the mind, to develop political intelligence,
to awaken civic consciousness, to
interest the pupil in civic duty, and to prepare
him, through instruction and practice,
for its exercise. The scope of the subject
should include actual government as found
in the local unit, the State, and the nation,
with so much of the history of government
as is needed to explain present institutions
and conditions. Enough of the theory of
government should be given to establish an
orderly arrangement of the subject matter
in the pupil’s mind. The ethical principles
underlying government should be examined
in a concrete way; and attention should be
given to the application of these principles
in the social duties of school life.</p>

<p>Civics should not be confounded with constitutional
history. It is important enough
to have its own field, and, while correlated
with history, economics and ethics, should
not be trammeled by either of these.</p>

<p>The most serious problem which the committee
had to solve was that of the order
of topics. Should local or national government
come first? The majority of the committee
favored local, State, national as the
order. They also decided that not more
than one-fourth of the time should be given
to a study of the federal government.</p>

<p>Much stress is laid on the importance of
studying local government, so far as possible,
at first hand. This necessitates frequent,
systematically-planned visits to
local bodies and careful study of local documents,
such as reports, specimen papers, etc.</p>

<p>No hard and fast form for the syllabus
has been used. Sometimes topics, sometimes
questions, and again statements are
used wherever best adapted to the purpose.</p>

<p>The committee consists of Dr. Hay
Greene Huling, English High School, Cambridge,
chairman; Wilson R. Butler, High
School, New Bedford; Professor L. B.
Evans, Tufts College; Dr. John Haynes,
Dorchester High School; Dr. W. B. Munro,
Harvard University. Mr. Butler is editor
for the committee.</p>


<h3>Report of the Committee of Eight.</h3>

<p>This report on history in the elementary
grades has been prepared by a committee
of the American Historical Association,
Professor James A. James, of Northwestern
University, chairman, and will be published
this fall by “Scribner’s.” The work for
each of the eight grades is treated in detailed
topics accompanied by reading lists
for teachers and for pupils. The object of
the course for the first two grades is “to
give the child an impression of primitive
life and an appreciation of public holidays.”
Grade three deals with Heroes of Other
Times, Columbus, and the Indians. In
the fourth and fifth grades emphasis is
placed on Historical Scenes and Persons
in American History. The object sought
in grade six is to impress on the child’s
mind that “the beginnings of American
ways of living are to be sought far back
in the story of the world.” The topics,
therefore, seek to bring out the contributions
made by Greeks, Romans, and the
people of medieval Europe, especially England,
closing with the defeat of the Spanish
Armada. The seventh grade topics deal
with the exploration and settlement of
North America and the growth of the colonies
to 1763. The eighth grade topics
bring United States history down to the
present time, and suggest subjects for supplementary
talks on European history.</p>

<p>The report also contains a chapter on
Methods, an “Outline for Teaching the Development
of a Constitutional Government
in the Eighth Grade in Three Lessons of
Forty Minutes Each,” contributed by Miss
Blanche A. Cheney, of the Lowell, Mass.,
State Normal School; an “Outline for
Teaching the Birth of the German Nation
in the Eighth Grade,” by Miss Blanche E.
Hazard, of the Brockton, Mass., High
School; an article on elementary civics, and
appendices on history teaching in German,
French and English elementary schools.</p>

<p>The subject of history in the elementary
grades has also been treated in a stimulating
manner in a course prepared by Superintendent
W. F. Gordy for the schools of
Springfield, Mass. The work is here outlined
for nine grades, the last being devoted
to English history as related to the
history of our own country.</p>


<h3>NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>The next meeting of the New England
History Teachers’ Association will be held
on Saturday, October 16, in Boston. The
Council seriously considered for a time the
expediency of waiving the constitutional
requirement and holding the meeting in the
western part of Massachusetts, probably in
Greenfield. The preference of a large
minority of the members for Boston, however,
led the Council to follow the regular
practice of holding the annual meeting in
Boston. The association has held meetings
in Springfield, Hartford and Portland, and
the wisdom of meeting once a year outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of Boston seems proved by the large attendance
at those places.</p>

<p>Had the meeting been held in Greenfield,
the subject would have been “Local Aids
in the Study of History,” a most appropriate
topic for a meeting in that richly historical
region. For the Boston meeting the
Council has selected the subject of “Economics,”
which has been clamoring for recognition
ever since the association was
founded.</p>

<p>Topics in economics enter to a considerable
extent into American history, but it is
a question how far economic theory should
be developed in a secondary school course.
The field is a tempting one to a teacher
filled with his subject: the fundamental
principles of money, foreign trade, rent,
capital and labor, corporate organization,
socialism, these and many others the young
man will inevitably come in contact with
daily. What guidance shall he have and
where shall he obtain it?</p>


<h3>Bibliographies.</h3>

<p>Of considerable value to all progressive
teachers of history is the “Annual List of
Books on History and Civics,” selected and
critically reviewed with reference to their
value for high school teachers and pupils
prepared by a special committee of the
North Central Association under the editorship
of Professor W. J. Chase, of the University
of Wisconsin. The list comprises
new books on teaching history, ancient,
medieval and modern, English history and
government, United States history and government.
Each title is accompanied by
name of publisher and price. There is a
critical estimate averaging half a page.
Text-books and special treatises on a small
field are not included. Copies may be obtained
of Mr. G. H. Gaston, Wendell Phillips
High School, Chicago, for twenty-five
cents.</p>

<p>“The Atlantic Educational Journal,”
published by the Maryland Educational
Publishing Company, Baltimore, Md., has
a “Bibliography of History for Schools,”
prepared by a committee of the Association
of History Teachers of Maryland under the
chairmanship of Professor C. M. Andrews.</p>

<p>The Macmillan Company published in
June the valuable bibliography prepared by
Miss Grace Gardner Griffin, entitled
“Writings on American History, 1907.”
This is the second year of the publication
of the work in this form; the volume contains
a bibliography of books and articles
upon Continental United States and Canada,
and some references to other portions
of America. Dr. J. Franklin Jameson,
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
has again supervised the making of
the year-book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A new commercial geography is announced
by Henry Holt &amp; Co. as in course of
preparation by Dr. John P. Goode, assistant
professor of geography in the University of
Chicago.</p>


<h3>EXCHANGE OF PROFESSORS IN THE SUMMER SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>An excellent result of the establishment
of summer schools has been the interchange
of the teaching forces of colleges
and universities; and on a minor scale the
employment of strong secondary school
men in summer college courses. Much
has been made of the international exchange
of professors recently brought about;
but unconsciously within our own country
there has been established a custom which
must prove very valuable not alone to institutions
inviting outside instructors, but
also to those instructors themselves, and
to their own institutions. Thus, taking the
history men alone last summer Harvard was
represented at the University of California,
Yale at Wisconsin, Leland Stanford at Kansas;
Columbia at Chicago, Wisconsin at Illinois,
University of the South at Michigan,
Indiana University at Cornell; Michigan at
Chicago; Brown at Harvard, and Pennsylvania
at Columbia.</p>

<p>Such an exchange of instructors cannot
but bring about a mutual education; and
when it is remembered that the same policy
of exchange is going on in many other
subjects than history, it will be seen that
we have here a great power for good.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Messrs. Ginn &amp; Co. are continuing the
excellent undertaking of furnishing source-material
for history teachers and scholars,
which they began so auspiciously with
Prof. Robinson’s “Readings in European
History,” and followed with Robinson and
Beard’s “Readings in Modern European
History.” Professor Cheyney’s “Readings
in English History” was reviewed in the
September number. The same publishers
now announce two new books: “Selections
from the Economic History of the United
States, 1760-1860,” by Professor Guy S. Collender,
of Yale University; and “Readings
on American Federal Government,” by Professor
Paul S. Reinsch, of the University of
Wisconsin.</p>

<p>An “American Historical Series” made
up of text-books that will be comprehensive,
systematic and authoritative, is announced
by Messrs. Henry Holt &amp; Co., the
publishers of the well-known “American
Science Series.” In the new series Professor
Colby, of McGill University, will prepare a
book on Mediæval and Modern Europe, and
one on the Renaissance and Reformation.
Professor S. B. Fay, of Dartmouth College,
is at work upon a volume entitled,
“Europe in the XVII and XVIII Centuries;”
Professor R. C. H. Catterall, of Cornell, will
treat of the “French Revolution and Napoleon;”
and Professor C. D. Hazen, of Smith
College, will write the volume upon
“Europe in the Nineteenth Century.”
There will be also a history of the United
States by Professor Frederick J. Turner; a
history of Greece, by Professor Paul
Shorey; and a history of Rome, by Director
Jesse B. Carter.</p>

<h2><a id="Ref_44"></a>Correspondence</h2>


<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you on the
quality of your first number of <span class="smcap">The History
Teacher’s Magazine</span>.... I am
specially delighted to see the simplicity of
style in all the articles. It seems to me
that a reader wholly untrained in history
ought to be able to follow each article with
comparative ease. Most of the articles
might have been written so that none but
specialists would appreciate them.” <span class="coffset">S. A. D.</span></p>

<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>“I notice in your magazine an account
of the translations and reprints from the
series of European history covering the
period from the Roman times to the nineteenth
century. Do you know of any work
similar to this covering the period of Ancient
History?” <span class="coffset">M. C. S.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ans.</span>&mdash;There are two good source books
on Ancient History published by D. C.
Heath &amp; Co., entitled Munro’s “Source Book
of Roman History” and Fling’s “Source
Book of Greek History.”</p>

<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly give the publisher of
Cheyney’s ‘European Background of American
History’ and Farrand’s ‘Basis of
American History?’” <span class="coffset">L. B. M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ans.</span>&mdash;Cheyney’s work is Vol. I in Hart’s
“American Nation”; Farrand’s is Vol. II in
the same series. The work is published by
Harpers, and the volumes can be bought
separately.</p>

<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>“Can you refer me to a short work giving
an account of the migrations of the
barbarians?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ans.</span>&mdash;The writer knows of no primer or
handbook upon the barbarian invasions.
One of the best of the accounts is that in
Emerton’s “Introduction to the Middle
Ages.” Shorter, but very good, is the chapter
in Robinson’s “Introduction to the History
of Western Europe.” More detailed
accounts, with other matter interspersed,
will be found in Hodgkin’s “Dynasty of
Theodosius,” and in Oman’s “The Dark
Ages.” Extended accounts will, of course,
be found in Sargeant’s “The Franks,”
Hodgkin’s “Theodoric,” Valari’s “Barbarian
Invaders of Italy,” Hodgkin’s “Italy
and Her Invaders,” and in Bury’s “Later
Roman Empire” and his edition of Gibbon.
There is a short work by Rev. William H.
Hutton entitled “The Church and the Barbarians.”
An excellent word picture of the
invasions is to be found in Freytag’s
“Bilder aus dem Mittelalter.”</p>

<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>“I was interested in your <span class="smcap">History
Teacher’s Magazine</span> and will hand it to our
history teacher. I write asking you to recommend
some periodicals for English
teachers of a similar nature.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ans.</span>&mdash;We know of no periodical for English
teachers exactly similar to our own.
The following magazines are largely devoted
to research rather than to practical
methods of teaching English: “Modern
Language Notes,” Baltimore, Md., eight
months a year, $1.50 a year; “Modern
Philology,” University of Chicago Press,
quarterly; $3.00 a year; “Modern Language
Review,” Cambridge, England, 12
shillings, 6 pence; “Publications of the
Modern Language Association of America,”
Cambridge, Mass.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
